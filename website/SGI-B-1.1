          SGI License Grant. Subject to the terms of this License and any third party intellectual property
             claims, for the duration of intellectual property protections inherent in the Original Code,
             SGI hereby grants Recipient a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, to do the

             Licensable Patents, to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import and/or otherwise

             patent license shall apply to the Covered Code if, at the time any related Modification is

             Patents. The patent license in Section 2.1(ii) shall not apply to any other combinations that
             include the Modification. No patent license is provided under SGI Patents for infringements of

          Termination. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if
             Recipient breaches any term herein and fails to cure such breach within 30 days thereof. Any
             sublicense to the Covered Code that is properly granted shall survive any termination of this

             name, trademark or service mark whatsoever, including without limitation any related right for
             purposes of endorsement or promotion of products derived from the Covered Code, without prior
             written permission of SGI; or (iii) any title to or ownership of the Original Code, which

             way infringes (directly or contributorily) any intellectual property rights of any kind of any
             other person or entity or (ii) breaches any representation or warranty, express, implied or
             statutory, to which, under any applicable law, it might be deemed to have been subject.

          Versions of the License. SGI may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to
             time, each with a distinguishing version number. Once Covered Code has been published under a
             particular version of the License, Recipient may, for the duration of the license, continue to
             use it under the terms of that version, or choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of
             any subsequent version published by SGI. Subject to the provisions of Sections 3 and 4 of this
             License, only SGI may modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this
             License.
