                Third Party Claims.
                <p>If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party&apos;s intellectual property
                   rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1

                   &quot;LEGAL&apos;&apos; which describes the claim and the party making the claim in
                   sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such
                   knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2,
                   Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available
                   thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or
                   newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new
                   knowledge has been obtained.</p>

                 to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must
                 include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely
                 to look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as
                 a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in
                 any documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients&apos; rights or ownership

                 support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code.
                 However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or

                 description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice
                 must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation
                 or collateral in which You describe recipients&apos; rights relating to the Covered Code. You
                 may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of

                 license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are

              <p>The Interbase public license is based on the Mozilla Public License V 1.1 with the following changes:
                <br />

      The license is published by Borland Software Corporation. Only Borland Software Corporation
                     can modify the terms applicable to Covered Code.
                <br />

      The license can be modified used for code which is not already governed by this license.
                     Modified versions of the license must be renamed to avoid confusion with Netscape?s or
                     Interbase Software?s license and must include a description of changes from the
                     Interbase Public License.
                <br />

      The name of the license in Exhibit A is the &quot;Interbase Public License&quot;.
                <br />

      The reference to an alternative license in Exhibit A has been removed.
                <br />

      Amendments I, II, III, V, and VI have been deleted.
                <br />

      Exhibit A, Netscape Public License has been deleted
                <br />

      A new amendment (II) has been added, describing the required and restricted rights to use
                     the trademarks of Borland Software Corporation

If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.&#10;&#10;         &lt;&lt;var;name=&quot;bullet&quot;;original=&quot;(b)&quot;;match=&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Contributor APIs.&#10;&#10;         If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL file.&#10;&#10;         &lt;&lt;var;name=&quot;bullet&quot;;original=&quot;(c)&quot;;match=&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Representations.&#10;&#10;         Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.&#10;&#10;      &lt;&lt;var;name=&quot;bullet&quot;;original=&quot;3.5.&quot;;match=&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Required Notices.&#10;&#10;      You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.&#10;&#10;      &lt;&lt;var;name=&quot;bullet&quot;;original=&quot;3.6.&quot;;match=&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Distribution of Executable Versions.&#10;&#10;      You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.&#10;&#10;      &lt;&lt;var;name=&quot;bullet&quot;;original=&quot;3.7.&quot;;match=&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Larger Works.&#10;&#10;      You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.&#10;&#10;   &lt;&lt;var;name=&quot;bullet&quot;;original=&quot;4.&quot;;match=&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.&#10;&#10;   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.&#10;&#10;   &lt;&lt;var;name=&quot;bullet&quot;;original=&quot;5.&quot;;match=&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Application of this License.&#10;&#10;   This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.&#10;&#10;   &lt;&lt;var;name=&quot;bullet&quot;;original=&quot;6.&quot;;match=&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Versions of the License.&#10;&#10;      &lt;&lt;var;name=&quot;bullet&quot;;original=&quot;6.1.&quot;;match=&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; New Versions.&#10;&#10;      Borland Software Corporation (''Interbase'') may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time.

You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Interbase. No one other than Interbase has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.&#10;&#10;      &lt;&lt;var;name=&quot;bullet&quot;;original=&quot;6.3.&quot;;match=&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Derivative Works.&#10;&#10;      If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases ''Mozilla'', ''MOZILLAPL'', ''MOZPL'', ''Netscape'', &quot;MPL&quot;, ''NPL&quot;, &quot;Interbase&quot;, &quot;ISC&quot;, &quot;IB'' or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)&#10;&#10;      &lt;&lt;var;name=&quot;bullet&quot;;original=&quot;6.4&quot;;match=&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Origin of the Interbase Public License.&#10;&#10;      The Interbase public license is based on the Mozilla Public License V 1.1 with the following changes:&#10;&#10;      The license is published by Borland Software Corporation.
