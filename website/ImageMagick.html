               if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the
               Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
               of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You
               may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute,
               alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such

          Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works
