      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="2.2.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Contributor Grant. Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property claims:

         &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="(a)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications created by such Contributor (or portions thereof) either on an unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Code or as part of a Larger Work; and

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.1.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Application of License. The Modifications which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.2.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Availability of Source Code. Any Modification which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.3.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Description of Modifications. You must cause all Covered Code to which you contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.4.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Intellectual Property Matters

         &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="(a)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Third Party Claims. If You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual property right in particular functionality or code (or its utilization under this License), you must include a text file with the source code distribution titled ``LEGAL'' which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after You make Your Modification available as described in Section 3.2, You shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.

         &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="(b)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Contributor APIs. If Your Modification is an application programming interface and You own or control patents which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, you must also include this information in the LEGAL file.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.5.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code, and this License in any documentation for the Source Code, where You describe recipients' rights relating to Covered Code. If You created one or more Modification(s), You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then you must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.6.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.7.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="4.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation. If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="5.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Application of this License.

   This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code.

                  Third Party Claims. If You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual property right
                     in particular functionality or code (or its utilization under this License), you must
                     include a text file with the source code distribution titled ``LEGAL&amp;apos;&amp;apos; which
                     describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient
                     will know whom to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after You make Your Modification
                     available as described in Section 3.2, You shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all
                     copies You make available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying
                     appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who
                     received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.

                  Contributor APIs. If Your Modification is an application programming interface and You own or
                     control patents which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, you must also
                     include this information in the LEGAL file.

              Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code, and
                 this License in any documentation for the Source Code, where You describe recipients&amp;apos;
                 rights relating to Covered Code. If You created one or more Modification(s), You may add your
                 name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. If it is not possible to put such
                 notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then you must include such
                 notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look
                 for such a notice. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
                 indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may
                 do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor.
                 You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability
                 obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer
                 and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor
                 as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;3.6.&lt;/var&gt;
              Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if
                 the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a
                 notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms
                 of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations
                 of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable
                 version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients&amp;apos; rights
                 relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code under
                 a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that
                 You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable
                 version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient&amp;apos;s rights in the Source Code
                 version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version
                 under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from
                 this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You
                 hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability
                 incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You
                 offer.

                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;3.7.&lt;/var&gt;
              Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed
                 by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a
                 case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered
                 Code.
            &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;

            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;4.&lt;/var&gt;
          Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation. If it is impossible for You to comply with any
             of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute or
             regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent
             possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be
             included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all
             distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation,
             such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
             understand it.
        &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;5.&lt;/var&gt;
          Application of this License.
          &lt;p&gt;This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in
             Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code.&lt;/p&gt;
