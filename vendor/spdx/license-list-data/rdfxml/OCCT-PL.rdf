         &lt;p&gt;Open CASCADE Technology Public License
        &lt;br /&gt;

Version 6.6, April 2013
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;OPEN CASCADE releases and makes publicly available the source code of the software Open CASCADE
         Technology to the free software development community under the terms and conditions of this
         license.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;It is not the purpose of this license to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right
         claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this license has the sole purpose of protecting the
         integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices.
         Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
         system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if
         he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that
         choice.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Please read this license carefully and completely before downloading this software. By downloading,
         using, modifying, distributing and sublicensing this software, you indicate your acceptance to be
         bound by the terms and conditions of this license. If you do not want to accept or cannot accept for
         any reasons the terms and conditions of this license, please do not download or use in any manner this
         software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul style="list-style:none"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;1.&lt;/var&gt;
          Definitions
          &lt;p&gt;Unless there is something in the subject matter or in the context inconsistent therewith, the
             capitalized terms used in this License shall have the following meaning.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Applicable Intellectual Property Rights&amp;quot; means (a) with respect to the Initial
             Developer, any rights under patents or patents applications or other intellectual property
             rights that are now or hereafter acquired, owned by or assigned to the Initial Developer and
             that cover subject matter contained in the Original Code, but only to the extent necessary to
             use, reproduce, modify, distribute or sublicense the Original Code without infringement; and
             (b) with respect to You or any Contributor, any rights under patents or patents applications
             or other intellectual property rights that are now or hereafter acquired, owned by or assigned
             to You or to such Contributor and that cover subject matter contained in Your Modifications or
             in such Contributor&amp;apos;s Modifications, taken alone or in combination with Original
             Code.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Contributor&amp;quot; means each individual or legal entity that creates or contributes to the
             creation of any Modification, including the Initial Developer.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Modifications&amp;quot;: mean any addition to, deletion from or change to the substance or the
             structure of the Software. When source code of the Software is released as a series of files,

             containing the Software or (b) any new file or other representation of computer program
             statements that contains any part of the Software. By way of example, Modifications include

             originally made available by the Initial Developer under this License, including the source
             code of any updates or upgrades of the Original Code and (b) the object code compiled from
             such source code and originally made available by Initial Developer under this License.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Software&amp;quot;: means the Original Code, the Modifications, the combination of Original
             Code and any Modifications or any respective portions thereof.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Your&amp;quot;: means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights
             under this License&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;2.&lt;/var&gt;

             attached to the Software with your Modifications.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;For greater certainty, it is expressly understood that You may freely create Derivative Programs

                 the Initial Developer.

            Relationship of the Parties This License will not be construed as creating an agency,
               partnership, joint venture or any other form of legal association between You and the
               Initial Developer, and You will not represent to the contrary, whether expressly, by

            Severability If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of this
               License, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable, that provision of the License will be
               enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the economic benefits and
               intent of the parties, and the remainder of this License will continue in full force and

If you do not want to accept or cannot accept for any reasons the terms and conditions of this license, please do not download or use in any manner this software.
