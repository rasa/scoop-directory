        &lt;p&gt;In addition to the rights set forth in the other license(s) included in the distribution for this software, data, and/or documentation (collectively the &amp;quot;Software,&amp;quot; and such licenses collectively with this additional permission the &amp;quot;Software License&amp;quot;), the copyright holders wish to facilitate interoperability with other software, data, and/or documentation distributed with complete corresponding source under a license that is OSI-approved and/or categorized by the FSF as free (collectively &amp;quot;Other FOSS&amp;quot;).  We therefore hereby grant the following additional permission with respect to the use and distribution of the Software with Other FOSS, and the constants, function signatures, data structures and other invocation methods used to run or interact with each of them (as to each, such software&amp;apos;s &amp;quot;Interfaces&amp;quot;):&lt;/p&gt;

The Software&amp;apos;s Interfaces remain at all times under the Software License, including without limitation as used in the Other FOSS (which upon any such use also then contains a portion of the Software under the Software License).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;(ii)&lt;/var&gt; The Other FOSS&amp;apos;s Interfaces may, to the extent permitted by the license of the Other FOSS, be copied into, used and distributed in the Software in order to enable interoperability, without requiring that such Interfaces be licensed under the terms of the Software License or otherwise altering their original terms, if this does not require any portion of the Software other than such Interfaces to be licensed under the terms other than the Software License.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;(iii)&lt;/var&gt; If only Interfaces and no other code is copied between the Software and the Other FOSS in either direction, the use and/or distribution of the Software with the Other FOSS shall not be deemed to require that the Other FOSS be licensed under the license of the Software, other than as to any Interfaces of the Software copied into the Other FOSS.  This includes, by way of example and without limitation, statically or dynamically linking the Software together with Other FOSS after enabling interoperability using the Interfaces of one or both, and distributing the resulting combination under different licenses for the respective portions thereof.&lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;For avoidance of doubt, a license which is OSI-approved or categorized by the FSF as free, includes, for the purpose of this permission, such licenses with additional permissions, and any license that has previously been so-approved or categorized as free, even if now deprecated or otherwise no longer recognized as approved or free.  Nothing in this additional permission grants any right to distribute any portion of the Software on terms other than those of the Software License or grants any additional permission of any kind for use or distribution of the Software in conjunction with software other than Other FOSS.&lt;/p&gt;
