          (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark) to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Original Code (or portions thereof) with or without Modifications, or as part of a Larger Work; and

          (b) under patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by Initial Developer, to make, have made, use and sell (``offer to sell and import'') the Original Code (or portions thereof), but solely to the extent that any such patent is reasonably necessary to enable You to Utilize the Original Code (or portions thereof) and not to any greater extent that may be necessary to Utilize further Modifications or combinations.

     2.2. Contributor Grant. Each Contributor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property claims:

          (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark) to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications created by such Contributor (or portions thereof) either on an unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Code or as part of a Larger Work; and

          (b) under patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by Contributor, to to make, have made, use and sell (``offer to sell and import'') the Contributor Version (or portions thereof), but solely to the extent that any such patent is reasonably necessary to enable You to Utilize the Contributor Version (or portions thereof), and not to any greater extent that may be necessary to Utilize further Modifications or combinations

3. Distribution Obligations.

     3.1. Application of License. The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.

     3.2. Availability of Source Code. Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available, prior to any use, except for internal development and practice, in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made available to such recipients. You shall notify the Initial Developer of the Modification and the location of the Source Code via the contact means provided for in the Developer Specific license. Initial Developer will be acting as maintainer of the Source Code and may provide an Electronic Distribution mechanism for the Modification to be made available.

     3.3. Description of Modifications. You must cause all Covered Code to which you contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.

     3.4. Intellectual Property Matters

          (a) Third Party Claims. If You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual property right in particular functionality or code (or its utilization under this License), you must include a text file with the source code distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after You make Your Modification available as described in Section 3.2, You shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.

          (b) Representations. Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.

     3.5. Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code, and this License in any documentation for the Source Code, where You describe recipients' rights relating to Covered Code. If You created one or more Modification(s), You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then you must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

     3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer. If you distribute executable versions containing Covered Code, you must reproduce the notice in Exhibit B in the documentation and/or other materials provided with the product.

     3.7. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) Cite all of the statutes or regulations that prohibit you from complying fully with this license. (c) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5. Application of this License.

This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code.

6. Versions of the License.

     6.1. New Versions. License Author may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number and shall be submitted to opensource.org for certification.

     6.2. Effect of New Versions. Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Initial Developer. No one other than Initial Developer has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.

     6.3. Derivative Works. If you create or use a modified version of this License, except in association with the required Developer Specific License described in section 6.4, (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), you must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases ``Open'', ``OpenPL'', ``OPL'' or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear anywhere in your license and (b) otherwise make it clear that your version of the license contains terms which differ from the Open Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)

     6.4. Required Additional Developer Specific License
This license is a union of the following two parts that should be found as text files in the same place (directory), in the order of preeminence:

          [1] A Developer specific license.

          [2] The contents of this file OPL_1_0.TXT, stating the general licensing policy of the software.

In case of conflicting dispositions in the parts of this license, the terms of the lower-numbered part will always be superseded by the terms of the higher numbered part.

7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

8. TERMINATION.

     8.1 Termination upon Breach
This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code, which are properly granted, shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions that, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

     8.2. Termination Upon Litigation. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as "Participant") alleging that:

          (a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.

          (b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant.

     8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.

     8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.

9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

The Covered Code is a ``commercial item,'' as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of ``commercial computer software'' and ``commercial computer software documentation,'' as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.

            Contributor Grant. Each Contributor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
               non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property claims:
          
&lt;ul style="list-style:none"&gt;

                        &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;(a)&lt;/var&gt;
              under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark) to use, reproduce,
                 modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications created by such
                 Contributor (or portions thereof) either on an unmodified basis, with other
                 Modifications, as Covered Code or as part of a Larger Work; and
            &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
                        &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;(b)&lt;/var&gt;
              under patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by Contributor, to to make, have made,
                 use and sell (``offer to sell and import&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) the Contributor Version (or
                 portions thereof), but solely to the extent that any such patent is reasonably
                 necessary to enable You to Utilize the Contributor Version (or portions thereof), and
                 not to any greater extent that may be necessary to Utilize further Modifications or
                 combinations
            &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
               &lt;/li&gt;

          Distribution Obligations.

&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;3.1.&lt;/var&gt;
            Application of License. The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are
               governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The
               Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this
               License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must
               include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may
               not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the
               applicable version of this License or the recipients&amp;apos; rights hereunder. However, You
               may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section
               3.5.
          &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;3.2.&lt;/var&gt;
            Availability of Source Code. Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute
               must be made available, prior to any use, except for internal development and practice, in
               Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable
               version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an
               Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism,
               must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became
               available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular
               Modification has been made available to such recipients. You shall notify the Initial
               Developer of the Modification and the location of the Source Code via the contact means
               provided for in the Developer Specific license. Initial Developer will be acting as
               maintainer of the Source Code and may provide an Electronic Distribution mechanism for the
               Modification to be made available.
          &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;3.3.&lt;/var&gt;
            Description of Modifications. You must cause all Covered Code to which you contribute to
               contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date
               of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived,
               directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including
               the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an
               Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership
               of the Covered Code.
          &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;3.4.&lt;/var&gt;
            Intellectual Property Matters
          
&lt;ul style="list-style:none"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
                        &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;(a)&lt;/var&gt;
              Third Party Claims. If You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual property
                 right in particular functionality or code (or its utilization under this License), you
                 must include a text file with the source code distribution titled &amp;quot;LEGAL&amp;quot;
                 which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a
                 recipient will know whom to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after You make Your
                 Modification available as described in Section 3.2, You shall promptly modify the
                 LEGAL file in all copies You make available thereafter and shall take other steps
                 (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to
                 inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.
            &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
                        &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;(b)&lt;/var&gt;
              Representations. Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section
                 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor&amp;apos;s Modifications are
                 Contributor&amp;apos;s original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to
                 grant the rights conveyed by this License.
            &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
               &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;3.5.&lt;/var&gt;
            Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code,
               and this License in any documentation for the Source Code, where You describe
               recipients&amp;apos; rights relating to Covered Code. If You created one or more
               Modification(s), You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit
               A. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its
               structure, then you must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory
               file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. You may choose to offer, and
               to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more
               recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
               behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that
               any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and
               You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any
               liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,
               support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.
          &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;3.6.&lt;/var&gt;
            Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only
               if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You
               include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available
               under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have
               fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any
               notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe
               recipients&amp;apos; rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable
               version of Covered Code under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different
               from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and
               that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the
               recipient&amp;apos;s rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this
               License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make
               it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You
               alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the
               Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial
               Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer. If you distribute
               executable versions containing Covered Code, you must reproduce the notice in Exhibit B in
               the documentation and/or other materials provided with the product.
          &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;3.7.&lt;/var&gt;
            Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not
               governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product.
               In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the
               Covered Code.
          &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;4.&lt;/var&gt;
          Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.
          &lt;p&gt;If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some
             or all of the Covered Code due to statute or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the
             terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) Cite all of the statutes or
             regulations that prohibit you from complying fully with this license. (c) describe the
             limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file
             described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code.
             Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
             sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;5.&lt;/var&gt;
          Application of this License.
          &lt;p&gt;This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A,
             and to related Covered Code.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;6.&lt;/var&gt;
          Versions of the License.
        
&lt;ul style="list-style:none"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;6.1.&lt;/var&gt;
            New Versions. License Author may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time
               to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number and shall be submitted
               to opensource.org for certification.
          &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;6.2.&lt;/var&gt;
            Effect of New Versions. Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of
               the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may
               also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the
               License published by Initial Developer. No one other than Initial Developer has the right
               to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.
          &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;6.3.&lt;/var&gt;
            Derivative Works. If you create or use a modified version of this License, except in
               association with the required Developer Specific License described in section 6.4, (which
               you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by
               this License), you must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases ``Open&amp;apos;&amp;apos;,
               ``OpenPL&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, ``OPL&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear
               anywhere in your license and (b) otherwise make it clear that your version of the license
               contains terms which differ from the Open Public License. (Filling in the name of the
               Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall
               not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)
          &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;6.4.&lt;/var&gt;
            Required Additional Developer Specific License
              &lt;br /&gt;

      This license is a union of the following two parts that should be found as text files
                   in the same place (directory), in the order of preeminence:

&lt;ul style="list-style:none"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
                        &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;[1]&lt;/var&gt;
              A Developer specific license.
            &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
                        &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;[2]&lt;/var&gt;
              The contents of this file OPL_1_0.TXT, stating the general licensing policy of the software.
            &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;In case of conflicting dispositions in the parts of this license, the terms of the
                 lower-numbered part will always be superseded by the terms of the higher numbered
                 part.&lt;/p&gt;

               &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;7.&lt;/var&gt;
          DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
          &lt;p&gt;COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN &amp;quot;AS IS&amp;quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF
             ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE
             COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.
             THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY
             COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER
             CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER
             OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS
             AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;8.&lt;/var&gt;
          TERMINATION.
        
&lt;ul style="list-style:none"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;8.1&lt;/var&gt;
            Termination upon Breach
              &lt;br /&gt;

      This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail
                   to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of
                   becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code, which are
                   properly granted, shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions that,
                   by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License
                   shall survive.

          &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;8.2.&lt;/var&gt;
            Termination Upon Litigation. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement
               claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor
               (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as
               &amp;quot;Participant&amp;quot;) alleging that:
          
&lt;ul style="list-style:none"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
                        &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;(a)&lt;/var&gt;
              such Participant&amp;apos;s Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent,
                 then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or
                 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate
                 prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree
                 in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past
                 and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your
                 litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If
                 within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not
                 mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not
                 withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2
                 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified
                 above.
            &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
                        &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;(b)&lt;/var&gt;
              any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant&amp;apos;s Contributor
                 Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You
                 by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the
                 date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that
                 Participant.
            &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
               &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;8.3.&lt;/var&gt;
            If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such
               Participant&amp;apos;s Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where
               such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of
               patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such
               Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the
               amount or value of any payment or license.
          &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;8.4.&lt;/var&gt;
            In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license agreements
               (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any
               distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.
          &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;9.&lt;/var&gt;

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.1.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Application of License. The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.2.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Availability of Source Code. Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available, prior to any use, except for internal development and practice, in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made available to such recipients. You shall notify the Initial Developer of the Modification and the location of the Source Code via the contact means provided for in the Developer Specific license. Initial Developer will be acting as maintainer of the Source Code and may provide an Electronic Distribution mechanism for the Modification to be made available.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.3.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Description of Modifications. You must cause all Covered Code to which you contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.4.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Intellectual Property Matters

         &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="(a)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Third Party Claims. If You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual property right in particular functionality or code (or its utilization under this License), you must include a text file with the source code distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after You make Your Modification available as described in Section 3.2, You shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.

         &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="(b)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Representations. Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.5.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code, and this License in any documentation for the Source Code, where You describe recipients' rights relating to Covered Code. If You created one or more Modification(s), You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then you must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.6.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer. If you distribute executable versions containing Covered Code, you must reproduce the notice in Exhibit B in the documentation and/or other materials provided with the product.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.7.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="4.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.

   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) Cite all of the statutes or regulations that prohibit you from complying fully with this license. (c) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="5.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Application of this License.

   This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="6.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Versions of the License.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="6.1.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; New Versions. License Author may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number and shall be submitted to opensource.org for certification.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="6.2.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Effect of New Versions. Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Initial Developer. No one other than Initial Developer has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="6.3.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Derivative Works. If you create or use a modified version of this License, except in association with the required Developer Specific License described in section 6.4, (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), you must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases ``Open'', ``OpenPL'', ``OPL'' or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear anywhere in your license and (b) otherwise make it clear that your version of the license contains terms which differ from the Open Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="6.4.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Required Additional Developer Specific License

      This license is a union of the following two parts that should be found as text files in the same place (directory), in the order of preeminence:

         &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="[1]";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; A Developer specific license.

         &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="[2]";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; The contents of this file OPL_1_0.TXT, stating the general licensing policy of the software.

      In case of conflicting dispositions in the parts of this license, the terms of the lower-numbered part will always be superseded by the terms of the higher numbered part.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="7.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

   COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="8.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; TERMINATION.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="8.1";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Termination upon Breach

      This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code, which are properly granted, shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions that, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="8.2.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Termination Upon Litigation. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as "Participant") alleging that:

         &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="(a)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.

         &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="(b)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="8.3.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="8.4.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="9.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

   UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
