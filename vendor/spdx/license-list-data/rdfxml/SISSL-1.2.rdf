            Application of License. The Source Code version of Original Code may be distributed only under the
               terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must
               include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not
               offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable
               version of this License or the recipients rights hereunder. Your license for shipment of the
               Contributor Version is conditioned upon Your full compliance with this Section. The Modifications
               which You create must comply with all requirements set out by the Standards body in effect one
               hundred twenty (120) days before You ship the Contributor Version. In the event that the
               Modifications do not meet such requirements, You agree to publish either (i) any deviation from
               the Standards protocol resulting from implementation of Your Modifications and a reference
               implementation of Your Modifications or (ii) Your Modifications in Source Code form, and to make
               any such deviation and reference implementation or Modifications available to all third parties
               under the same terms a this license on a royalty free basis within thirty (30) days of Your first
               customer shipment of Your Modifications. Additionally, in the event that the Modifications you
               create do not meet the requirements set out in this Section, You agree to comply with the
               Standards requirements set out in Exhibit B.
          &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;3.2&lt;/var&gt;
            Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If it
               is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You
               must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely
               to look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add Your name as a
               Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any
               documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients rights or ownership rights
               relating to Initial Code.
            &lt;p&gt;You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability
               obligations to one or more recipients of Your version of the Code. However, You may do so only on
               Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer. You must make it absolutely clear
               than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and
               You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer for any liability incurred by the Initial
               Developer as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.&lt;/p&gt;

               &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;3.3&lt;/var&gt;
            Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Original Code in Executable and Source form
               only if the requirements of Sections 3.1 and 3.2 have been met for that Original Code, and if You
               include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Original Code is available under the
               terms of this License. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable or
               Source versions, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients rights
               relating to the Original Code. You may distribute the Executable and Source versions of Your
               version of the Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms
               different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License.
               If You distribute the Executable and Source versions under a different license You must make it
               absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by
               the Initial Developer. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer for any liability
               incurred by the Initial Developer as a result of any such terms You offer.
          &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;3.4&lt;/var&gt;
            Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Original Code with other code not governed by
               the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You
               must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Original Code.
          &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
         &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;4.0&lt;/var&gt;
        INABILITY TO COMPLY DUE TO STATUTE OR REGULATION
        &lt;p&gt;If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or
           all of the Original Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply
           with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations
           and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section
           3.2 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent
           prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
           recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.&lt;/p&gt;

         &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;5.0&lt;/var&gt;
        APPLICATION OF THIS LICENSE
        &lt;p&gt;This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A and
           to related Modifications as set out in Section 3.1.&lt;/p&gt;

         &lt;/li&gt;

            Effect of New Versions. Once Original Code has been published under a particular version of the

               use such Original Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Sun.
               No one other than Sun has the right to modify the terms applicable to Original Code.
          &lt;/li&gt;

            This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with
               terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All
               sublicenses to the Original Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this
               License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this
               License shall survive. 8.2 In the event of termination under Section 8.1 above, all end user

               or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.

      You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Your version of the Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.2 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
