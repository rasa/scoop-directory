         &lt;p&gt;Introduction&lt;/p&gt;

         &lt;p&gt;The FreeType Project is distributed in several archive packages; some of them may contain, in addition to
         the FreeType font engine, various tools and contributions which rely on, or relate to, the FreeType
         Project.&lt;/p&gt;

         &lt;p&gt;This license applies to all files found in such packages, and which do not fall under their own explicit
         license. The license affects thus the FreeType font engine, the test programs, documentation and
         makefiles, at the very least.&lt;/p&gt;

         &lt;p&gt;This license was inspired by the BSD, Artistic, and IJG (Independent JPEG Group) licenses, which all
         encourage inclusion and use of free software in commercial and freeware products alike. As a
         consequence, its main points are that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul style="list-style:none"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
               &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;o&lt;/var&gt;
          We don&amp;apos;t promise that this software works. However, we will be interested in any kind of bug reports.
             (`as is&amp;apos; distribution)
        &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
               &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;o&lt;/var&gt;
          You can use this software for whatever you want, in parts or full form, without having to pay us.
             (`royalty-free&amp;apos; usage)
        &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
               &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;o&lt;/var&gt;
          You may not pretend that you wrote this software. If you use it, or only parts of it, in a program, you
             must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that you have used the FreeType code. (`credits&amp;apos;)
        &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
         &lt;p&gt;We specifically permit and encourage the inclusion of this software, with or without modifications, in
         commercial products. We disclaim all warranties covering The FreeType Project and assume no liability
         related to The FreeType Project.&lt;/p&gt;

         &lt;p&gt;Finally, many people asked us for a preferred form for a credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this
         license. We thus encourage you to use the following text:&lt;/p&gt;

         &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot; Portions of this software are copyright © &amp;lt;year&amp;gt; The FreeType Project (www.freetype.org). All

          Definitions
          &lt;p&gt;Throughout this license, the terms `package&amp;apos;, `FreeType Project&amp;apos;, and `FreeType archive&amp;apos; refer to
             the set of files originally distributed by the authors (David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and

            &lt;p&gt;`You&amp;apos; refers to the licensee, or person using the project, where `using&amp;apos; is a generic term
             including compiling the project&amp;apos;s source code as well as linking it to form a `program&amp;apos; or
             `executable&amp;apos;. This program is referred to as `a program using the FreeType engine&amp;apos;.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;This license applies to all files distributed in the original FreeType Project, including all
             source code, binaries and documentation, unless otherwise stated in the file in its original,
             unmodified form as distributed in the original archive. If you are unsure whether or not a
             particular file is covered by this license, you must contact us to verify this.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;The FreeType Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000 by David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner

                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;o&lt;/var&gt;
              Redistribution in binary form must provide a disclaimer that states that the software is based
                 in part of the work of the FreeType Team, in the distribution documentation. We also encourage
                 you to put an URL to the FreeType web page in your documentation, though this isn&amp;apos;t
                 mandatory.
            &lt;/li&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the FreeType Project, not just

            &lt;p&gt;We suggest, but do not require, that you use one or more of the following phrases to refer to

             Project is copyrighted material, only this license, or another one contracted with the
