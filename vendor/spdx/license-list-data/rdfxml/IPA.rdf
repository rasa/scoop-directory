          &amp;quot;Licensed Program&amp;quot; shall mean a Digital Font Program licensed by the Licensor under
             this Agreement.
        &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;

          &amp;quot;Derived Program&amp;quot; shall mean a Digital Font Program created as a result of a
             modification, addition, deletion, replacement or any other adaptation to or of a part or all
             of the Licensed Program, and includes a case where a Digital Font Program newly created by
             retrieving font information from a part or all of the Licensed Program or Embedded Fonts from
             a Digital Document File with or without modification of the retrieved font information.

             are used only in the display of characters in the particular Digital Document File within
             which they are embedded, and shall be distinguished from those in any Digital Font Program,

             Embedded Fonts of the Licensed Program are used only for rendering the Digital Content within
             such Digital Document File then such Recipient shall have no further obligations under this
             Agreement in relation to such actions.
        &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;6.&lt;/var&gt;

             provisions set forth in Article 3 Paragraph 2.

          The Recipient may create, use, reproduce and/or Redistribute a Derived Program under the terms
             stated above for the Licensed Program: provided, that the Recipient shall follow the
             provisions set forth in Article 3 Paragraph 1 when Redistributing the Derived Program.
        &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;1.&lt;/var&gt;
          If a Derived Program is Redistributed pursuant to Paragraph 4 and 7 of the preceding Article, the

              The following must be also Redistributed together with the Derived Program, or be made
                 available online or by means of mailing mechanisms in exchange for a cost which does not
                 exceed the total costs of postage, storage medium and handling fees:
              
&lt;ul style="list-style:none"&gt;

                  a copy of the Derived Program; and
                &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
                        &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;(b)&lt;/var&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;(2)&lt;/var&gt;
              It is required to also Redistribute means to enable recipients of the Derived Program to
                 replace the Derived Program with the Licensed Program first released under this License
                 (the &amp;quot;Original Program&amp;quot;). Such means may be to provide a difference file from
                 the Original Program, or instructions setting out a method to replace the Derived Program
                 with the Original Program.

&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;(5)&lt;/var&gt;
              Any material to be made available online or by means of mailing a medium to satisfy the
                 requirements of this paragraph may be provided, verbatim, by any party wishing to do
                 so.
            &lt;/li&gt;

              The Recipient must attach a copy of this Agreement to the Licensed Program.
            &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
