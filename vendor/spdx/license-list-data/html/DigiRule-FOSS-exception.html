<ul style="list-style:none">
<li>
                  <var class="replacable-license-text">1.</var>
              You obey the GPL in all respects for the Program and all
                 portions (including modifications) of the Program
                 included in the Derivative Work (provided that this

<li>
                  <var class="replacable-license-text">2.</var>
              The Derivative Work does not include any work licensed

<li>
                  <var class="replacable-license-text">3.</var>
              You distribute Independent Works subject to a license

                 under the same FOSS license applying to the object
                 code or executable forms;
            </li>
<li>
                  <var class="replacable-license-text">5.</var>
              All works that are aggregated with the Program or the
                 Derivative Work on a medium or volume of storage are
                 not derivative works of the Program, Derivative Work
                 or FOSS Application, and must reasonably be considered
                 independent and separate works.
