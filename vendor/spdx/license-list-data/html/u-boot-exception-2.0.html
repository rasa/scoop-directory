      <p>Even though U-Boot in general is covered by the GPL-2.0/GPL-2.0+,
         this does *not* cover the so-called &quot;standalone&quot; applications
         that use U-Boot services by means of the jump table provided
         by U-Boot exactly for this purpose - this is merely considered
         normal use of U-Boot, and does *not* fall under the heading of
         &quot;derived work&quot;.</p>

      <p>The header files &quot;include/image.h&quot; and
         &quot;arch/*/include/asm/u-boot.h&quot; define interfaces to U-Boot.
         Including these (unmodified) header files in another file is
         considered normal use of U-Boot, and does *not* fall under the
         heading of &quot;derived work&quot;.
