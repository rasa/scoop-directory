      You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available
                   under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the

                   under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the
                   Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or otherwise make

           extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction&apos;s
           conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the
           jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice

           contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. You agree
