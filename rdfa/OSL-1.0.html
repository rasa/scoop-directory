             perpetual, non-sublicenseable license, under patent claims owned or controlled by the Licensor
             that are embodied in the Original Work as furnished by the Licensor (&quot;Licensed

             Original Work for making modifications to it and all available documentation describing how to
             access and modify the Original Work. Licensor hereby agrees to provide a machine-readable copy
             of the Source Code of the Original Work along with each copy of the Original Work that
             Licensor distributes. Licensor reserves the right to satisfy this obligation by placing a

             distribute the Original Work, and by publishing the address of that information repository in
             a notice immediately following the copyright notice that applies to the Original Work.

<li>
            <var class="replacable-license-text">4)</var>
          Exclusions From License Grant. Nothing in this License shall be deemed to grant any rights to

             except as expressly stated herein. No patent license is granted to make, use, sell or offer to

             right is granted to the trademarks of Licensor even if such marks are included in the Original
             Work. Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under
             different terms from this License any Original Work that Licensor otherwise would have a right
             to license.

          External Deployment. The term &quot;External Deployment&quot; means the use or distribution of
             the Original Work or Derivative Works in any way such that the Original Work or Derivative
             Works may be accessed or used by anyone other than You, whether the Original Work or
             Derivative Works are distributed to those persons, made available as an application intended
             for use over a computer network, or used to provide services or otherwise deliver content to
             anyone other than You. As an express condition for the grants of license hereunder, You agree

          Warranty and Disclaimer of Warranty. LICENSOR WARRANTS THAT THE COPYRIGHT IN AND TO THE ORIGINAL
             WORK IS OWNED BY THE LICENSOR OR THAT THE ORIGINAL WORK IS DISTRIBUTED BY LICENSOR UNDER A
             VALID CURRENT LICENSE FROM THE COPYRIGHT OWNER. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN THE IMMEDIATELY
             PRECEEDING SENTENCE, THE ORIGINAL WORK IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot;
             BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE
             WARRANTY OF NON-INFRINGEMENT AND WARRANTIES THAT THE ORIGINAL WORK IS MERCHANTABLE OR FIT FOR
             A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH YOU. THIS
             DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO LICENSE TO ORIGINAL

          Limitation of Liability. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
             (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR
             ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER ARISING
             AS A RESULT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE ORIGINAL WORK INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
             DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL
             OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PERSON SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE

             DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY&apos;S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE
             LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF
             INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO
             YOU.

          Acceptance and Termination. Nothing else but this License (or another written agreement between
             Licensor and You) grants You permission to create Derivative Works based upon the Original
             Work, and any attempt to do so except under the terms of this License (or another written
             agreement between Licensor and You) is expressly prohibited by U.S. copyright law, the
             equivalent laws of other countries, and by international treaty. Therefore, by exercising any
             of the rights granted to You in Sections 1 and 2 herein, You indicate Your acceptance of this
             License and all of its terms and conditions. This license shall terminate immediately and you
             may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License upon Your failure to
             honor the proviso in Section 1(c) herein.
        </li>
<li>
            <var class="replacable-license-text">9)</var>
          Mutual Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically and You may no
             longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License if You file a lawsuit in any
             court alleging that any OSI Certified open source software that is licensed under any license
             containing this &quot;Mutual Termination for Patent Action&quot; clause infringes any patent
             claims that are essential to use that software.
        </li>
<li>
            <var class="replacable-license-text">10)</var>
          Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. You agree that any lawsuit arising under or relating to
             this License shall be maintained in the courts of the jurisdiction wherein the Licensor
             resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary business, and under the laws of that
             jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The application of the United Nations
             Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of
             the Original Work outside the scope of this License or after its termination shall be subject
             to the requirements and penalties of the U.S. Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. § 101 et seq., the
             equivalent laws of other countries, and international treaty. This section shall survive the
             termination of this License.
        </li>
<li>
            <var class="replacable-license-text">11)</var>
          Attorneys Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License or seeking damages relating
             thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and expenses, including,
             without limitation, reasonable attorneys&apos; fees and costs incurred in connection with such
             action, including any appeal of such action. This section shall survive the termination of
             this License.
        </li>
<li>
            <var class="replacable-license-text">12)</var>
          Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter
             hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be
             reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.
        </li>
<li>
            <var class="replacable-license-text">13)</var>
          Definition of &quot;You&quot; in This License. &quot;You&quot; throughout this License, whether
             in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights under, and
             complying with all of the terms of, this License. For legal entities, &quot;You&quot; includes

Nothing else but this License (or another written agreement between Licensor and You) grants You permission to create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work, and any attempt to do so except under the terms of this License (or another written agreement between Licensor and You) is expressly prohibited by U.S. copyright law, the equivalent laws of other countries, and by international treaty.

This license shall terminate immediately and you may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License upon Your failure to honor the proviso in Section 1(c) herein.&#10;&#10;   &lt;&lt;var;name=&quot;bullet&quot;;original=&quot;9)&quot;;match=&quot;.{0,20}&quot;&gt;&gt; Mutual Termination for Patent Action.
