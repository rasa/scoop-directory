        <p>Using Creative Commons Public Licenses</p>

        <p>Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and conditions that creators and other
            rights holders may use to share original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
            and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The following considerations are for
            informational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.</p>

<ul style="list-style:none">
<li>
                <p>Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are intended for use by those authorized to give the
                    public permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by copyright and certain other rights.
                    Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions of the
                    license they choose before applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
                    applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material as expected. Licensors should clearly
                    mark any material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-licensed material, or material
                    used under an exception or limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors<var class="replacable-license-text">: wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors</var></p>

            </li>
<li>
               <p>Considerations for the public: By using one of our public licenses, a licensor grants the public
                    permission to use the licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If the licensor&apos;s
                    permission is not necessary for any reason–for example, because of any applicable exception or
                    limitation to copyright–then that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only
                    permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
                    the licensed material may still be restricted for other reasons, including because others have
                    copyright or other rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that
                    all changes be marked or described. Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to
                    respect those requests where reasonable. <var class="replacable-license-text">More considerations</var> for the public<var class="replacable-license-text">: wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensees</var></p>

Creative Commons disclaims all liability for damages resulting from their use to the fullest extent possible.&#10;&#10;Using Creative Commons Public Licenses&#10;&#10;Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.&#10;&#10;   Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are intended for use by those authorized to give the public permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions of the license they choose before applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-licensed material, or material used under an exception or limitation to copyright.

If the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason–for example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to copyright–then that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be restricted for other reasons, including because others have copyright or other rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that all changes be marked or described. Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to respect those requests where reasonable. &lt;&lt;var;name=&quot;spaceUnderscore&quot;;original=&quot;More considerations&quot;;match=&quot;More considerations|More_considerations&quot;&gt;&gt; for the public &lt;&lt;var;name=&quot;considerationsLicensees&quot;;original=&quot;: wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensees&quot;;match=&quot;: wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensees|\\.&quot;&gt;&gt;&#10;&#10;   &lt;&lt;endOptional&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;beginOptional&gt;&gt; Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International Public License&#10;&#10;&lt;&lt;endOptional&gt;&gt;&#10;&#10;By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International Public License (&quot;Public License&quot;).
