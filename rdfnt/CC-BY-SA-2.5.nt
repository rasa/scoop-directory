You may not\n               offer or impose any terms on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License or\n               the recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not sublicense the\n               Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of\n               warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly\n               digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that control access or use of\n               the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The above\n               applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the\n               Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this\n               License. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the\n               extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any credit as required by clause 4(c),\n               as requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to\n               the extent practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any credit as required by clause\n               4(c), as requested.\n          </li>\n<li>\n                  <var class=\"replacable-license-text\">b.</var>\n            You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform a\n               Derivative Work only under the terms of this License, a later version of this License with\n               the same License Elements as this License, or a Creative Commons iCommons license that\n               contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g. Attribution-ShareAlike 2.5\n               Japan). You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License\n               or other license specified in the previous sentence with every copy or phonorecord of each\n               Derivative Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally\n               perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Derivative Works that alter or\n               restrict the terms of this License or the recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted\n               hereunder, and You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the\n               disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or\n               publicly digitally perform the Derivative Work with any technological measures that\n               control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License\n               Agreement. The above applies to the Derivative Work as incorporated in a Collective Work,\n               but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the Derivative Work itself to be\n               made subject to the terms of this License.\n          </li>\n<li>\n                  <var class=\"replacable-license-text\">c.</var>\n            If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work\n               or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep intact all copyright notices\n               for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the\n               name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or (ii) if the\n               Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g. a sponsor\n               institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution in Licensor&apos;s copyright\n               notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties;\n               the title of the Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform\n               Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work,\n               unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the\n               Work; and in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use of the Work in\n               the Derivative Work (e.g., &quot;French translation of the Work by Original Author,&quot;\n               or &quot;Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author&quot;).
