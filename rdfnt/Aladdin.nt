The Program is a copyrighted work whose copyright is held by Aladdin Enterprises (the \"Licensor\"). Please note that Aladdin Ghostscript is neither the program known as \"GNU Ghostscript\" nor the version of Ghostscript available for commercial licensing from Artifex Software Inc.\n\n   A \"work based on the Program\" means either the Program or any derivative work of the Program, as defined in the United States Copyright Act of 1976, such as a translation or a modification.\n\n   BY MODIFYING OR DISTRIBUTING THE PROGRAM (OR ANY WORK BASED ON THE PROGRAM), YOU INDICATE YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THIS LICENSE TO DO SO, AND ALL ITS TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTING OR MODIFYING THE PROGRAM OR WORKS BASED ON IT. NOTHING OTHER THAN THIS LICENSE GRANTS YOU PERMISSION TO MODIFY OR DISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM OR ITS DERIVATIVE WORKS. THESE ACTIONS ARE PROHIBITED BY LAW.

The following methods of distribution involving payment shall not in and of themselves be a violation of this restriction:\n\n         <<var;name=\"bullet\";original=\"(i)\";match=\".{0,20}\">> Posting the Program on a public access information storage and retrieval service for which a fee is received for retrieving information (such as an on-line service), provided that the fee is not content-dependent (i.e., the fee would be the same for retrieving the same volume of information consisting of random data) and that access to the service and to the Program is available independent of any other product or service. An example of a service that does not fall under this section is an on-line service that is operated by a company and that is only available to customers of that company. (This is not an exhaustive enumeration.)\n\n         <<var;name=\"bullet\";original=\"(ii)\";match=\".{0,20}\">> Distributing the Program on removable computer-readable media, provided that the files containing the Program are reproduced entirely and verbatim on such media, that all information on such media be redistributable for non-commercial purposes without charge, and that such media are distributed by themselves (except for accompanying documentation) independent of any other product or service. Examples of such media include CD-ROM, magnetic tape, and optical storage media. (This is not intended to be an exhaustive list.) An example of a distribution that does not fall under this section is a CD-ROM included in a book or magazine. (This is not an exhaustive enumeration.)\n\n      <<var;name=\"bullet\";original=\"(b)\";match=\".{0,20}\">> Activities other than copying, distribution and modification of the Program are not subject to this License and they are outside its scope.

Such notice must also state that users may redistribute the Work only under the conditions of this License and tell the user how to view the copy of this License included with the Work. (Exceptions: if the Program is interactive but normally prints or displays such an announcement only at the request of a user, such as in an \"About box\", the Work is required to print or display the notice only under the same circumstances; if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, the Work is not required to print an announcement.);\n\n         <<var;name=\"bullet\";original=\"(iv)\";match=\".{0,20}\">> You must accompany the Work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, delivered on a medium customarily used for software interchange.

If you distribute with the Work any component that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, you must also distribute the source code of that component if you have it and are allowed to do so;\n\n         <<var;name=\"bullet\";original=\"(v)\";match=\".{0,20}\">> If you distribute any written or printed material at all with the Work, such material must include either a written copy of this License, or a prominent written indication that the Work is covered by this License and written instructions for printing and/or displaying the copy of the License on the distribution medium;\n\n         <<var;name=\"bullet\";original=\"(vi)\";match=\".{0,20}\">> You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipient's exercise of the rights granted herein.\n\n         If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering the equivalent ability to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent ability to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source code along with the object code.\n\n   <<var;name=\"bullet\";original=\"3.\";match=\".{0,20}\">> Reservation of Rights.\n\n   No rights are granted to the Program except as expressly set forth herein. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n   <<var;name=\"bullet\";original=\"4.\";match=\".{0,20}\">> Other Restrictions.\n\n   If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries for any reason, Licensor may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n   <<var;name=\"bullet\";original=\"5.\";match=\".{0,20}\">> Limitations.\n\n   THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED TO YOU \"AS IS,\" WITHOUT WARRANTY.

The following methods of distribution\n               involving payment shall not in and of themselves be a violation of this restriction:\n          </li>\n<ul style=\"list-style:none\">\n<li>\n                  <var class=\"replacable-license-text\">(i)</var>\n              Posting the Program on a public access information storage and retrieval service for\n                 which a fee is received for retrieving information (such as an on-line service),\n                 provided that the fee is not content-dependent (i.e., the fee would be the same for\n                 retrieving the same volume of information consisting of random data) and that access\n                 to the service and to the Program is available independent of any other product or\n                 service. An example of a service that does not fall under this section is an on-line\n                 service that is operated by a company and that is only available to customers of that\n                 company.

Examples of such media\n                 include CD-ROM, magnetic tape, and optical storage media. (This is not intended to be\n                 an exhaustive list.) An example of a distribution that does not fall under this\n                 section is a CD-ROM included in a book or magazine.
