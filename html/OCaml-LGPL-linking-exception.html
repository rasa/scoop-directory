              System</var>&quot; with a publicly distributed version of <var class="replacable-license-text">the OCaml Core
              System</var> to produce an executable file containing portions of
              <var class="replacable-license-text">the OCaml Core
              System</var>, and distribute that executable file under terms of

              clause 6 of the GNU Lesser General Public License. By &quot;a publicly
              distributed version of <var class="replacable-license-text">the OCaml Core

              reasons why the executable file might be covered by the GNU Lesser
              General Public License.
