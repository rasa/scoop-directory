                         indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the
                         name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an
                         Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or
                         ownership of the Covered Code.&lt;/p&gt;

                                Third Party Claims. If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party&amp;apos;s
                                 intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such
                                 Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the
                                 Source Code distribution titled &amp;quot;LEGAL&amp;quot; which describes the claim and the party
                                 making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If
                                 Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as described
                                 in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor
                                 makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate
                                 mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the
                                 Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.

                                Contributor APIs. If Contributor&amp;apos;s Modifications include an application programming
                                 interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary
                                 to implement that API, Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL
                                 file.

                                 above, Contributor believes that Contributor&amp;apos;s Modifications are Contributor&amp;apos;s
                                 original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed
                                 by this License.
                            &lt;/li&gt;

                        Required Notices.
                        &lt;p&gt;You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If it is not
                         possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure,
                         then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a
                         user would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or more
                         Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in
                         Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source
                         Code where You describe recipients&amp;apos; rights or ownership rights relating to
                         Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
                         indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However,
                         You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or
                         any Contributor.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;/li&gt;

                        Distribution of Executable Versions.
                        &lt;p&gt;You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section
                         3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version
                         of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain
                         terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms
                         of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to
                         limit or alter the recipient&amp;apos;s rights in the Source Code version from the rights
                         set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different
                         license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this
                         License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. If
                         you distribute executable versions containing Covered Code as part of a product, you
                         must reproduce the notice in Exhibit B in the documentation and/or other materials
                         provided with the product.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;/li&gt;

                        Larger Works.
                        &lt;p&gt;You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the
                         terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a
                         case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the
                         Covered Code.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;/li&gt;

                        Restrictions.
                        &lt;p&gt;You may not remove any product identification, copyright, proprietary notices or labels from gSOAP.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;/li&gt;

                INABILITY TO COMPLY DUE TO STATUTE OR REGULATION.
                &lt;p&gt;If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some
                 or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a)
                 comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the
                 limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file
                 described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code.
                 Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
                 sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.&lt;/p&gt;

                APPLICATION OF THIS LICENSE.
                &lt;p&gt;This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A
                 and to related Covered Code.&lt;/p&gt;

                        New Versions.
                        &lt;p&gt;Grantor may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each
                         version will be given a distinguishing version number.&lt;/p&gt;

                        Effect of New Versions.
                        &lt;p&gt;Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may
                         always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use
                         such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;/li&gt;

                        &lt;p&gt;If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order to
                         apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), You must
                         (a) rename Your license so that the phrase &amp;quot;gSOAP&amp;quot; or any confusingly
                         similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that you license differs
                         from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license
                         contains terms which differ from the gSOAP Public License. (Filling in the name of the
                         Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A
                         shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)&lt;/p&gt;

                         with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach.
                         All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination
                         of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the

                         infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant
                         under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of
                         any payment or license.

                 OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS

                 PARTY&amp;apos;S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO
                 NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND

         &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="(a)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark) Licensable by Initial Developer to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Original Code (or portions thereof) with or without Modifications, and/or as part of a Larger Work; and

         &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="(b)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; under patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by Initial Developer, to make, have made, use and sell ("offer to sell and import") the Original Code, Modifications, or portions thereof, but solely to the extent that any such patent is reasonably necessary to enable You to utilize, alone or in combination with other software, the Original Code, Modifications, or any combination or portions thereof.

         &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="(c)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt;

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="2.2.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Contributor Grant.

      Subject to third party intellectual property claims, each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license

         &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="(a)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark) Licensable by Contributor, to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications created by such Contributor (or portions thereof) either on an unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Code and/or as part of a Larger Work; and

         &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="(b)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; under patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by Contributor, to make, have made, use and sell ("offer to sell and import") the Contributor Version (or portions thereof), but solely to the extent that any such patent is reasonably necessary to enable You to utilize, alone or in combination with other software, the Contributor Version (or portions thereof).

         &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="(c)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt;

         &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="(d)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt;

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; DISTRIBUTION OBLIGATIONS.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.1.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Application of License.

      The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.2.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Availability of Source Code.

      Any Modification created by You &lt;&lt;var;name="shall";original="shall";match="shall|will"&gt;&gt; be provided to the Initial Developer in Source Code form and are subject to the terms of the License.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.3.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Description of Modifications.

      You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.4.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Intellectual Property Matters.

         &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="(a)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Third Party Claims. If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.

         &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="(b)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Contributor APIs. If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL file.

         &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="(c)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Representations. Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.5.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Required Notices.

      You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.6.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Distribution of Executable Versions.

      You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. If you distribute executable versions containing Covered Code as part of a product, you must reproduce the notice in Exhibit B in the documentation and/or other materials provided with the product.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.7.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Larger Works.

      You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.8.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Restrictions.

      You may not remove any product identification, copyright, proprietary notices or labels from gSOAP.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="4";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; INABILITY TO COMPLY DUE TO STATUTE OR REGULATION.

   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="5";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; APPLICATION OF THIS LICENSE.

   This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="6";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; VERSIONS OF THE LICENSE.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="6.1.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; New Versions.

      Grantor may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="6.2.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Effect of New Versions.

      Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="6.3.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Derivative Works.

      If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the phrase "gSOAP" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that you license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the gSOAP Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="7";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

   COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, AND ANY WARRANTY THAT MAY ARISE BY REASON OF TRADE USAGE, CUSTOM, OR COURSE OF DEALING.

SUCH LIMITATION ON DAMAGES INCLUDES, BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA OR SOFTWARE, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION OR IMPAIRMENT OF OTHER GOODS. IN NO EVENT WILL THE AUTHORS BE LIABLE FOR THE COSTS OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE SOFTWARE OR SERVICES. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS SOFTWARE IS NOT DESIGNED FOR USE IN ON-LINE EQUIPMENT IN HAZARDOUS ENVIRONMENTS SUCH AS OPERATION OF NUCLEAR FACILITIES, AIRCRAFT NAVIGATION OR CONTROL, OR LIFE-CRITICAL APPLICATIONS.

FOR PURPOSES OF THIS PARAGRAPH, THE TERM "LIFE-CRITICAL APPLICATION" MEANS AN APPLICATION IN WHICH THE FUNCTIONING OR MALFUNCTIONING OF THE SOFTWARE MAY RESULT DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY IN PHYSICAL INJURY OR LOSS OF HUMAN LIFE. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="8";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; TERMINATION.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="8.1.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="8.2.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt;

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="8.3.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="8.4.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="9";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

   UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

3  DISTRIBUTION OBLIGATIONS.

3.1. Application of License.
The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.

3.2. Availability of Source Code.
Any Modification created by You will be provided to the Initial Developer in Source Code form and are subject to the terms of the License.

3.3. Description of Modifications.
You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.

3.4. Intellectual Property Matters.
     (a) Third Party Claims. If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.

     (b) Contributor APIs. If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL file.

     (c) Representations. Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.

3.5. Required Notices.
You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor.

3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.
You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. If you distribute executable versions containing Covered Code as part of a product, you must reproduce the notice in Exhibit B in the documentation and/or other materials provided with the product.

3.7. Larger Works.
You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

3.8. Restrictions.
You may not remove any product identification, copyright, proprietary notices or labels from gSOAP.

4  INABILITY TO COMPLY DUE TO STATUTE OR REGULATION.

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5  APPLICATION OF THIS LICENSE.

This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.

6  VERSIONS OF THE LICENSE.

6.1. New Versions.
Grantor may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.

6.2. Effect of New Versions.
Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License.

6.3. Derivative Works.
If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the phrase "gSOAP" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that you license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the gSOAP Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)

8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.
