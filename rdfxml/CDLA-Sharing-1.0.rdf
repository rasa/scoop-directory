      under these terms and conditions shall be deemed sufficient
      consideration for the formation of this Agreement. Accordingly,

            as a contractor or agent to perform work on that Entity&amp;apos;s
            behalf. A &amp;quot;Publication&amp;quot; occurs each time You Publish Data.

          &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;Section 3.&lt;/var&gt;
        Conditions on Rights Granted
        
&lt;ul style="list-style:none"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;3.1&lt;/var&gt;
            If You Publish Data You Receive or Enhanced Data:
            
&lt;ul style="list-style:none"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
                &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;(a)&lt;/var&gt;
                The Data (including the Enhanced Data) must be Published
                under this Agreement in accordance with this Section 3; and
              &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
                &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;(b)&lt;/var&gt;
                You must cause any Data files containing Enhanced Data to
                carry prominent notices that You have changed those files; and
              &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
                &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;(c)&lt;/var&gt;
                If You Publish Data You Receive, You must preserve all credit
                or attribution to the Data Provider(s). Such retained credit
                or attribution includes any of the following to the extent
                they exist in Data as You have Received it: legal notices
                or metadata; identification of the Data Provider(s); or
                hyperlinks to Data to the extent it is practical to do so.
              &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;3.2&lt;/var&gt;
            You may not restrict or deter the ability of anyone who Receives
            the Data (a) to Publish the Data in a publicly-accessible manner
            or (b) if the project has designated a Ledger for recording
            Data or grants of rights in Data for purposes of this Agreement,
            to record the Data or grants of rights in Data in the Ledger.
          &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;3.3&lt;/var&gt;
            If You Publish Data You Receive, You must do so under an unmodified
            form of this Agreement and include the text of this Agreement, the
            name of this Agreement and/or a hyperlink or other method reasonably
            likely to provide a copy of the text of this Agreement. You may
            not modify this Agreement or impose any further restrictions on the
            exercise of the rights granted under this Agreement, including by
            adding any restriction on commercial or non-commercial Use of Data
            (including Your Enhanced Data) or by limiting permitted Use of such
            Data to any particular platform, technology or field of endeavor.
            Notices that purport to modify this Agreement shall be of no effect.
          &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;3.4&lt;/var&gt;
            You and each Data Provider agree that Enhanced Data shall not be
            considered a work of joint authorship by virtue of its relationship
            to Data licensed under this Agreement and shall not require either
            any obligation of accounting to or the consent of any Data Provider.
          &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;3.5&lt;/var&gt;
            This Agreement imposes no obligations or
            restrictions on Your Use or Publication of Results.
          &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;

        Data Provider(s)&amp;apos; Representations
        
&lt;ul style="list-style:none"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;4.1&lt;/var&gt;
            Each Data Provider represents that the Data Provider has
            exercised reasonable care, to assure that: (a) the Data it
            Publishes was created or generated by it or was obtained from
            others with the right to Publish the Data under this Agreement;
            and (b) Publication of such Data does not violate any privacy
            or confidentiality obligation undertaken by the Data Provider.
          &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;

        Termination
        
&lt;ul style="list-style:none"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;5.1&lt;/var&gt;
            All of Your rights under this Agreement will terminate, and
            Your right to Receive, Use or Publish the Data will be revoked
            or modified if You materially fail to comply with the terms
            and conditions of this Agreement and You do not cure such
            failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware
            of such noncompliance. If Your rights under this Agreement
            terminate, You agree to cease Receipt, Use and Publication of
            Data. However, Your obligations and any rights and permissions
            granted by You under this Agreement relating to Data that You
            Published prior to such termination will continue and survive.
          &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;5.2&lt;/var&gt;
            If You institute litigation against a Data Provider or anyone
            else who Receives the Data (including a cross-claim in a
            lawsuit) based on the Data, other than a claim asserting
            breach of this Agreement, then any rights previously granted
            to You to Receive, Use and Publish Data under this Agreement
            will terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
          &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            laws with regard to Use or Publication of Data Received hereunder.
          &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;7.2&lt;/var&gt;
            You and Data Provider(s), collectively and individually,

Your exercise of any of the rights and permissions granted below constitutes Your acceptance and agreement to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

The benefits that each Data Provider receives from making Data available and that You receive from Data or otherwise under these terms and conditions shall be deemed sufficient consideration for the formation of this Agreement. Accordingly, Data Provider(s) and You (the "Parties") agree as follows:

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="1.1";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; "Add" means to supplement Data with Your own or someone else's Data, resulting in Your "Additions." Additions do not include Results.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="1.2";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; "Computational Use" means Your analysis (through the use of computational devices or otherwise) or other interpretation of Data. By way of example and not limitation, "Computational Use" includes the application of any computational analytical technique, the purpose of which is the analysis of any Data in digital form to generate information about Data such as patterns, trends, correlations, inferences, insights and attributes.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="1.3";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; "Data" means the information (including copyrightable information, such as images or text), collectively or individually, whether created or gathered by a Data Provider or an Entity acting on its behalf, to which rights are granted under this Agreement.
