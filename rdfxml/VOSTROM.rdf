      &lt;p&gt;This VOSTROM Holdings, Inc. (VOSTROM) Distribution (code and documentation) is made available to the open
         source community as a public service by VOSTROM. Contact VOSTROM at license@vostrom.com for
         information on other licensing arrangements (e.g. for use in proprietary applications).&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Under this license, this Distribution may be modified and the original version and modified versions may
         be copied, distributed, publicly displayed and performed provided that the following conditions are
         met:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul style="list-style:none"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;1.&lt;/var&gt;
          Modified versions are distributed with source code and documentation and with permission for
             others to use any code and documentation (whether in original or modified versions) as granted

&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;2.&lt;/var&gt;
          if modified, the source code, documentation, and user run-time elements should be clearly labeled
             by placing an identifier of origin (such as a name, initial, or other tag) after the version
             number;
        &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;3.&lt;/var&gt;
          users, modifiers, distributors, and others coming into possession or using the Distribution in
             original or modified form accept the entire risk as to the possession, use, and performance of
             the Distribution;

&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;5.&lt;/var&gt;
          VOSTROM may make modifications to the Distribution that are substantially similar to modified
             versions of the Distribution, and may make, use, sell, copy, distribute, publicly display, and
             perform such modifications, including making such modifications available under this or other
             licenses, without obligation or restriction;

          modifications incorporating code, libraries, and/or documentation subject to any other open
             source license may be made, and the resulting work may be distributed under the terms of such
             open source license if required by that open source license, but doing so will not affect this
             Distribution, other modifications made under this license or modifications made under other
             VOSTROM licensing arrangements;
        &lt;/li&gt;
