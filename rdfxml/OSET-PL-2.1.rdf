			                     &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;a.&lt;/var&gt; under intellectual property rights (other than

            The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to
                 any Contribution become effective for each
                 Contribution on the date the Contributor first

          Limitations on Grant Scope&lt;br /&gt;

          The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only
             rights granted under this License.  No additional
             rights or licenses will be implied from the
             distribution or licensing of Covered Software under
             this License. Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no
             patent license is granted by a Contributor:
            
&lt;ul style="list-style:none"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
		                      &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;a.&lt;/var&gt; for any code that a Contributor has removed
			      from Covered Software; or
              &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
		                      &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;b.&lt;/var&gt; for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any
                   other third party&amp;apos;s modifications of Covered
                   Software, or (ii) the combination of its
                   Contributions with other software (except as part
		   of its Contributor Version); or
              &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
		                      &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;c.&lt;/var&gt; under Patent Claims infringed by Covered
		Software in the absence of its Contributions.
              &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the notice requirements in Section 3.4).&lt;/p&gt;

               &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
		                &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;2.4&lt;/var&gt; Subsequent Licenses&lt;br /&gt;

            No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of
            Your choice to distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent
            version of this License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a
            Secondary License (if permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).
        &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
		                &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;2.5&lt;/var&gt; Representation&lt;br /&gt;

            Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
            Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient
            rights to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.
        &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
	                 &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;2.6&lt;/var&gt;
	   Fair Use &lt;br /&gt;

	                 &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;2.7&lt;/var&gt;
	   Conditions &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
		                &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;3.1&lt;/var&gt; Distribution of Source Form &lt;br /&gt;

			All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form,
			including any Modifications that You create or to which You contribute,
			must be under the terms of this License.
			You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form of the Covered Software
			is governed by the terms of this License, and how they can obtain a copy
			of this License. You must cause any of Your Modifications to carry
			prominent notices stating that You changed the files.
			You may not attempt to alter or restrict the recipients&amp;apos; rights
			in the Source Code Form.
        &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
		                &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;3.2&lt;/var&gt;  Distribution of Executable Form &lt;br /&gt;

			If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:
      
&lt;ul style="list-style:none"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
                        &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;a.&lt;/var&gt;such Covered Software must also be made
               available in Source Code Form, as described in
               Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the
               Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such
               Source Code Form by reasonable means in a timely
               manner, at a charge no more than the cost of
	       distribution to the recipient; and
       &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
                        &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;b.&lt;/var&gt;You may distribute such Executable Form under
               the terms of this License, or sublicense it under
               different terms, provided that the license for the
               Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
               the recipients&amp;apos; rights in the Source Code Form
	       under this License.
       &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
               &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
		                &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;3.3&lt;/var&gt; Distribution of a Larger Work&lt;br /&gt;

			You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
			provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License
			for the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination
			of Covered Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses,
			and the Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses,
			this License permits You to additionally distribute
			such Covered Software under the terms of such Secondary License(s),
			so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option,
			further distribute the Covered Software under the terms
			of either this License or such Secondary License(s).
        &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;

		    You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
		    (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
		    or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form
		    of the Covered Software, except that You may alter
		    any license notices to the extent required to remedy
		    known factual inaccuracies.
        &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
		                      &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;3.5.1&lt;/var&gt; You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,
             warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations
             to one or more recipients of Covered Software.
             However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and
             not on behalf of any Contributor. You must make it
             absolutely clear that any such warranty, support,
             indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You
             alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every

             statute, judicial order, regulation (including without
             limitation state and federal procurement regulation),
             national security, or public interest. Any such
             additional conditions must be clearly described in the
             notice provisions required under Section 3.4.  Any
             alteration of the terms of this License will apply to
             all copies of the Covered Software distributed by You
             or by any downstream recipients that receive the
             Covered Software from You.
        &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
               &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
         &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;4.&lt;/var&gt;
          Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation&lt;br /&gt;

            If it is impossible for You to comply with any of
                 the terms of this License with respect to some
                 or all of the Covered Software due to statute,
                 judicial order, or regulation, then You must:
                 (a) comply with the terms of this License to
                 the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe
                 the limitations and the code they affect. Such
                 description must be included in the notices
                 required under Section 3.4. Except to the
                 extent prohibited by statute or regulation,
                 such description must be sufficiently detailed
                 for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able
                 to understand it.
        &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;5.&lt;/var&gt;
          Termination
      
&lt;ul style="list-style:none"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
		                &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;5.1&lt;/var&gt; Failure to Comply&lt;br /&gt;

			  The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
			  if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
			  compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
			  Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until
			  such Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants,
			  and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You
			  of the non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60-days
			  after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants
			  from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis
			  if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance
			  by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice
			  of non-compliance with this License from such Contributor,
			  and You become compliant prior to 30-days
			  after Your receipt of the notice.
        &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
		                &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;5.2&lt;/var&gt; Patent Infringement Claims&lt;br /&gt;

			  If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting
			  a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
			  counter-claims, and &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;cross-claims&lt;/var&gt;) alleging that a Contributor Version
			  directly or indirectly infringes any patent,
			  then the rights granted to You by any and all Contributors
			  for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License
			  shall terminate.
        &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
		                &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;5.3&lt;/var&gt; Additional Compliance Terms&lt;br /&gt;

			  Notwithstanding the foregoing in this Section 5,
			  for purposes of this Section, if You breach
			  Section 3.1 (Distribution of Source Form),
			  Section 3.2 (Distribution of Executable Form),
			  Section 3.3 (Distribution of a Larger Work), or
			  Section 3.4 (Notices), then becoming compliant
			  as described in Section 5.1 must also include,
			  no later than 30 days after receipt by You of notice
			  of such violation by a Contributor, making the Covered Software
			  available in Source Code Form as required by this License
			  on a publicly available computer network
			  for a period of no less than three (3) years.
        &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
		                &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;5.4&lt;/var&gt; Contributor Remedies&lt;br /&gt;

			  If You fail to comply with the terms of this License
			  and do not thereafter become compliant in accordance
			  with Section 5.1 and, if applicable, Section 5.3,
			  then each Contributor reserves its right, in addition
			  to any other rights it may have in law or in equity,
			  to bring an action seeking injunctive relief, or damages
			  for willful copyright or patent infringement
			  (including without limitation damages for unjust enrichment,
			  where available under law), for all actions in violation
			  of rights that would otherwise have been granted
			  under the terms of this License.
        &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
		                &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;5.5&lt;/var&gt; End User License Agreements&lt;br /&gt;

			In the event of termination under this Section 5,
			all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers),
			which have been validly granted by You or Your distributors
			under this License prior to termination shall survive termination.
        &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
		          &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;6.&lt;/var&gt; Disclaimer of Warranty &lt;br /&gt;

			Covered Software is provided under this License on
                 an &amp;quot;as is&amp;quot; basis, without warranty of any
                 kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory,
                 including, without limitation, warranties that
                 the Covered Software is free of defects,
                 merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or
                 non-infringing. The entire risk as to the
                 quality and performance of the Covered
                 Software is with You.  Should any Covered
                 Software prove defective in any respect, You
                 (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any
                 necessary servicing, repair, or correction.
		 This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this License.
		 No use of any Covered Software is authorized under this License
		 except under this disclaimer.
        &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
		          &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;7.&lt;/var&gt; Limitation of Liability &lt;br /&gt;

			Under no circumstances and under no legal theory,
                 whether tort (including negligence), contract,
                 or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone
                 who distributes Covered Software as permitted
                 above, be liable to You for any direct,
                 indirect, special, incidental, or
                 consequential damages of any character
                 including, without limitation, damages for
                 lost profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage,
                 computer failure or malfunction, or any and
                 all other commercial damages or losses, even
                 if such party shall have been informed of the
                 possibility of such damages. This limitation
                 of liability shall not apply to liability for
                 death or personal injury resulting from such
                 party&amp;apos;s negligence to the extent applicable
                 law prohibits such limitation. Some
                 jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or
                 limitation of incidental or consequential
                 damages, so this exclusion and limitation may
                 not apply to You.
        &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
		          &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;8.&lt;/var&gt; Litigation &lt;br /&gt;

			Any litigation relating to this License may be
                 brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction
                 where the defendant maintains its principal
                 place of business and such litigation shall be
                 governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without
                 reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.
                 Nothing in this Section shall prevent a
                 party&amp;apos;s ability to bring cross-claims or
                 counter-claims.
        &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;9.&lt;/var&gt; Government Terms
      
&lt;ul style="list-style:none"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
		                &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;9.1&lt;/var&gt; Commercial Item&lt;br /&gt;

			The Covered Software is a &amp;quot;commercial item,&amp;quot; as that term is defined
			in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of &amp;quot;commercial computer software&amp;quot;
			and &amp;quot;commercial computer software documentation,&amp;quot;
			as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995).
			Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1
			through 227.7202-4 (June 1995),
			all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software
			with only those rights set forth herein.
        &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
		                &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;9.2&lt;/var&gt; No Sovereign Immunity&lt;br /&gt;

			The U.S. federal government and states that use
			or distribute Covered Software hereby waive
			their sovereign immunity with respect to enforcement
			of the provisions of this License.
        &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;9.3&lt;/var&gt; Choice of Law and Venue
	  
&lt;ul style="list-style:none"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
			                     &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;9.3.1&lt;/var&gt; If You are a government of a state of the United
             States, or Your use of the Covered Software is
             pursuant to a procurement contract with such a state
             government, this License shall be governed by the law
             of such state, excluding its conflict-of-law
             provisions, and the adjudication of disputes relating
             to this License will be subject to the exclusive
             jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located
	     in such state.
     &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
	                       &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;9.3.2&lt;/var&gt; If You are an agency of the United States
                 federal government, or Your use of the Covered
                 Software is pursuant to a procurement contract
                 with such an agency, this License shall be
                 governed by federal law for all purposes, and
                 the adjudication of disputes relating to this
                 License will be subject to the exclusive
                 jurisdiction of the federal courts located in
		 Washington, D.C.
	 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
		                      &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;9.3.3&lt;/var&gt; You may alter the terms of this Section 9.3
                 for this License as described in Section
		 3.5.2.
	 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
               &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
		                &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;9.4&lt;/var&gt; Supremacy&lt;br /&gt;

			  This Section 9 is in lieu of, and supersedes,
			  any other Federal Acquisition Regulation,
			  Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation,
			  or other clause or provision that addresses government rights
			  in computer software under this License.
        &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
		          &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;10.&lt;/var&gt; Miscellaneous &lt;br /&gt;

			This License represents the complete agreement
                 concerning the subject matter hereof. If any
                 provision of this License is held to be
                 unenforceable, such provision shall be
                 reformed only to the extent necessary to make
                 it enforceable. Any law or regulation, which
                 provides that the language of a contract shall
                 be construed against the drafter, shall not be
                 used to construe this License against a
                 Contributor.
        &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;11.&lt;/var&gt; Versions of the License

&lt;li&gt;
		                &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;11.1&lt;/var&gt; New Versions&lt;br /&gt;

			The Open Source Election Technology Foundation (&amp;quot;OSET&amp;quot;)
			(formerly known as the Open Source Digital Voting Foundation)
			is the steward of this License.
			Except as provided in Section 11.3, no one other than the license steward
			has the right to modify or publish new versions of this License.
			Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.
        &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
		                &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;11.2&lt;/var&gt; Effects of New Versions&lt;br /&gt;

			You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version
			of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,
			or under the terms of any subsequent version
			published by the license steward.
        &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
		                &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;11.3&lt;/var&gt; Modified Versions&lt;br /&gt;

			If You create software not governed by this License,
			and You want to create a new license for such software,
			You may create and use a modified version of this License
			if You rename the license and remove any references
			to the name of the license steward
			(except to note that such modified license differs from this License).
        &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
		                &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;11.4&lt;/var&gt; Distributing Source Code Form That is Incompatible
			With Secondary Licenses&lt;br /&gt;

			If You choose to distribute Source Code Form
			that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses under the terms
			of this version of the License, the notice described
			in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.
        &lt;/li&gt;

         &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="b.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its Contributions or its Contributor Version.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="2.2";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Effective Date

      The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes such Contribution.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="2.3";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Limitations on Grant Scope

      The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:

         &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="a.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or

         &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="b.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor Version); or

         &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="c.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its Contributions.

      This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the notice requirements in Section 3.4).

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="2.4";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Subsequent Licenses

      No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="2.5";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Representation

      Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="2.6";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Fair Use

      This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="2.7";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Conditions

      Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in Section 2.1.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Responsibilities

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.1";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Distribution of Source Form

      All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You must cause any of Your Modifications to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files. You may not attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.2";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Distribution of Executable Form

      If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

         &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="a.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and

         &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="b.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.3";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Distribution of a Larger Work

      You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice, provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary License(s).

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.4";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Notices

      You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.5";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Application of Additional Terms

         &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.5.1";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any jurisdiction.

         &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.5.2";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; You may place additional conditions upon the rights granted in this License to the extent necessary due to statute, judicial order, regulation (including without limitation state and federal procurement regulation), national security, or public interest. Any such additional conditions must be clearly described in the notice provisions required under Section 3.4. Any alteration of the terms of this License will apply to all copies of the Covered Software distributed by You or by any downstream recipients that receive the Covered Software from You.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="4.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation

   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation, then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the notices required under Section 3.4. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="5.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Termination

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="5.1";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Failure to Comply

      The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60-days after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30-days after Your receipt of the notice.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="5.2";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Patent Infringement Claims

      If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and &lt;&lt;var;name="crossClaimsSpace";original="cross-claims";match="cross- claims|cross-claims"&gt;&gt; ) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License shall terminate.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="5.3";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Additional Compliance Terms

      Notwithstanding the foregoing in this Section 5, for purposes of this Section, if You breach Section 3.1 (Distribution of Source Form), Section 3.2 (Distribution of Executable Form), Section 3.3 (Distribution of a Larger Work), or Section 3.4 (Notices), then becoming compliant as described in Section 5.1 must also include, no later than 30 days after receipt by You of notice of such violation by a Contributor, making the Covered Software available in Source Code Form as required by this License on a publicly available computer network for a period of no less than three (3) years.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="5.4";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Contributor Remedies

      If You fail to comply with the terms of this License and do not thereafter become compliant in accordance with Section 5.1 and, if applicable, Section 5.3, then each Contributor reserves its right, in addition to any other rights it may have in law or in equity, to bring an action seeking injunctive relief, or damages for willful copyright or patent infringement (including without limitation damages for unjust enrichment, where available under law), for all actions in violation of rights that would otherwise have been granted under the terms of this License.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="5.5";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; End User License Agreements

      In the event of termination under this Section 5, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers), which have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to termination shall survive termination.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="6.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Disclaimer of Warranty

   Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is" basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="7.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Limitation of Liability

   Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="8.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Litigation

   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="9.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Government Terms

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="9.1";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Commercial Item

      The Covered Software is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer software" and "commercial computer software documentation," as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only those rights set forth herein.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="9.2";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; No Sovereign Immunity

      The U.S. federal government and states that use or distribute Covered Software hereby waive their sovereign immunity with respect to enforcement of the provisions of this License.

         &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="9.3.1";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; If You are a government of a state of the United States, or Your use of the Covered Software is pursuant to a procurement contract with such a state government, this License shall be governed by the law of such state, excluding its conflict-of-law provisions, and the adjudication of disputes relating to this License will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in such state.

         &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="9.3.2";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; If You are an agency of the United States federal government, or Your use of the Covered Software is pursuant to a procurement contract with such an agency, this License shall be governed by federal law for all purposes, and the adjudication of disputes relating to this License will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts located in Washington, D.C.

         &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="9.3.3";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; You may alter the terms of this Section 9.3 for this License as described in Section 3.5.2.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="9.4";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Supremacy

      This Section 9 is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other Federal Acquisition Regulation, Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation, or other clause or provision that addresses government rights in computer software under this License.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="10.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Miscellaneous

   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation, which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter, shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="11.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Versions of the License

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="11.1";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; New Versions

Except as provided in Section 11.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="11.2";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Effects of New Versions

      You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license steward.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="11.3";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Modified Versions

      If You create software not governed by this License, and You want to create a new license for such software, You may create and use a modified version of this License if You rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such modified license differs from this License).

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="11.4";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Distributing Source Code Form That is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses

Any such additional conditions must be clearly described in the notice provisions required under Section 3.4.  Any alteration of the terms of this License will apply to all copies of the Covered Software distributed by You or by any downstream recipients that receive the Covered Software from You.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation, then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the notices required under Section 3.4. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5. Termination

     5.1 Failure to Comply
	 The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60-days after You have come back into compliance.  Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30-days after Your receipt of the notice.

     5.2 Patent Infringement Claims      If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License shall terminate.

     5.3 Additional Compliance Terms
	 Notwithstanding the foregoing in this Section 5, for purposes of this Section, if You breach Section 3.1 (Distribution of Source Form), Section 3.2 (Distribution of Executable Form), Section 3.3 (Distribution of a Larger Work), or Section 3.4 (Notices), then becoming compliant as described in Section 5.1 must also include, no later than 30 days after receipt by You of notice of such violation by a Contributor, making the Covered Software available in Source Code Form as required by this License on a publicly available computer network for a period of no less than three (3) years.

     5.4 Contributor Remedies
	 If You fail to comply with the terms of this License and do not thereafter become compliant in accordance with Section 5.1 and, if applicable, Section 5.3, then each Contributor reserves its right, in addition to any other rights it may have in law or in equity, to bring an action seeking injunctive relief, or damages for willful copyright or patent infringement (including without limitation damages for unjust enrichment, where available under law), for all actions in violation of rights that would otherwise have been granted under the terms of this License.

     5.5 End User License Agreements
	 In the event of termination under this Section 5, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers), which have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to termination shall survive termination.

6. Disclaimer of Warranty
Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.  Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this License.  No use of any Covered Software is authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.

7. Limitation of Liability
Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.

8. Litigation
Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party’s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.

9. Government Terms

     9.1 Commercial Item
	 The Covered Software is a “commercial item,” as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of “commercial computer software” and “commercial computer software documentation,” as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only those rights set forth herein.

     9.2 No Sovereign Immunity
	 The U.S. federal government and states that use or distribute Covered Software hereby waive their sovereign immunity with respect to enforcement of the provisions of this License.

     9.3 Choice of Law and Venue

          9.3.1 If You are a government of a state of the United States, or Your use of the Covered Software is pursuant to a procurement contract with such a state government, this License shall be governed by the law of such state, excluding its conflict-of-law provisions, and the adjudication of disputes relating to this License will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in such state.
          9.3.2 If You are an agency of the United States federal government, or Your use of the Covered Software is pursuant to a procurement contract with such an agency, this License shall be governed by federal law for all purposes, and the adjudication of disputes relating to this License will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts located in Washington, D.C.
          9.3.3 You may alter the terms of this Section 9.3 for this License as described in Section 3.5.2.

     9.4 Supremacy
	 This Section 9 is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other Federal Acquisition Regulation, Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation, or other clause or provision that addresses government rights in computer software under this License.

10. Miscellaneous
This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation, which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter, shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.

11. Versions of the License

     11.1 New Versions The Open Source Election Technology Foundation (“OSET”) (formerly known as the Open Source Digital Voting Foundation) is the steward of this License.
