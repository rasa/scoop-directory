                 Recipient may distribute the source code and/or executable version(s) of Covered Code under
                 (1) this License; (2) a license identical to this License but for only such changes as are
                 necessary in order to clarify Recipient&amp;apos;s role as licensor of Modifications, without
                 derogation of any of SGI&amp;apos;s rights; and/or (3) a license of Recipient&amp;apos;s choosing, containing

                 terms of such license. If Recipient elects to use any license other than this License,

          Termination. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if
             Recipient breaches any term herein and fails to cure such breach within 30 days thereof. Any
             sublicense to the Covered Code that is properly granted shall survive any termination of this
             License, absent termination by the terms of such sublicense. Provisions that, by their nature,
             must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License, shall survive.
        &lt;/li&gt;

             under this License are reserved.

             control laws, regulations, and executive orders, of the U.S. government and other countries.

             intellectual property rights of any kind) of any other person or entity or (ii) breaches any
             representation or warranty, express, implied or statutory, to which, under any applicable law,
             it might be deemed to have been subject.
        &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;

             property rights, Recipient will promptly notify SGI of such claim.
        &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;

             time, each with a distinguishing version number. Once Covered Code has been published under a
             particular version of the License, Recipient may, for the duration of the license, continue to
             use it under the terms of that version, or choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of
             any subsequent version published by SGI. Subject to the provisions of Sections 3 and 4 of this
             License, only SGI may modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this
