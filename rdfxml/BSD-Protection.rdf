         &lt;p&gt;Preamble
        &lt;br /&gt;

--------
      &lt;/p&gt;

         &lt;p&gt;The Berkeley Software Distribution (&amp;quot;BSD&amp;quot;) license has proven very effective over the years at
         allowing for a wide spread of work throughout both commercial and non-commercial products. For
         programmers whose primary intention is to improve the general quality of available software, it is
         arguable that there is no better license than the BSD license, as it permits improvements to be used
         wherever they will help, without idealogical or metallic constraint.&lt;/p&gt;

         &lt;p&gt;This is of particular value to those who produce reference implementations of proposed standards: The
         case of TCP/IP clearly illustrates that freely and universally available implementations leads the
         rapid acceptance of standards -- often even being used instead of a de jure standard (eg, OSI network
         models).&lt;/p&gt;

         &lt;p&gt;With the rapid proliferation of software licensed under the GNU General Public License, however, the
         continued success of this role is called into question. Given that the inclusion of a few lines of
         &amp;quot;GPL-tainted&amp;quot; work into a larger body of work will result in restricted distribution -- and
         given that further work will likely build upon the &amp;quot;tainted&amp;quot; portions, making them difficult
         to remove at a future date -- there are inevitable circumstances where authors would, in order to
         protect their goal of providing for the widespread usage of their work, wish to guard against such
         &amp;quot;GPL-taint&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

         &lt;p&gt;In addition, one can imagine that companies which operate by producing and selling (possibly
         closed-source) code would wish to protect themselves against the rise of a GPL-licensed competitor.
         While under existing licenses this would mean not releasing their code under any form of open license,
         if a license existed under which they could incorporate any improvements back into their own
         (commercial) products then they might be far more willing to provide for non-closed distribution.&lt;/p&gt;

         &lt;p&gt;For the above reasons, we put forth this &amp;quot;BSD Protection License&amp;quot;: A license designed to retain
         the freedom granted by the BSD license to use licensed works in a wide variety of settings, both
         non-commercial and commercial, while protecting the work from having future contributors restrict that
         freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

         &lt;p&gt;The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution, and modification follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
               &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;a)&lt;/var&gt;
            &amp;quot;Program&amp;quot;, below, refers to any program or work distributed under the terms of this
               license.
          &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
               &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;b)&lt;/var&gt;
            A &amp;quot;work based on the Program&amp;quot;, below, refers to either the Program or any
               derivative work under copyright law.
          &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
               &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;c)&lt;/var&gt;
            &amp;quot;Modification&amp;quot;, below, refers to the act of creating derivative works.
          &lt;/li&gt;

               &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;d)&lt;/var&gt;
            &amp;quot;You&amp;quot;, below, refers to each licensee.

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;1.&lt;/var&gt;
          Scope.
            &lt;br /&gt;

   This license governs the copying, distribution, and modification of the Program. Other
                 activities are outside the scope of this license; The act of running the Program is
                 not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents
                 constitute a work based on the Program.

        &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;2.&lt;/var&gt;
          Verbatim copies.
            &lt;br /&gt;

   You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program as you receive it, in any
                 medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
                 appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License
                 and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a
                 copy of this License along with the Program.

        &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;3.&lt;/var&gt;
          Modification and redistribution under closed license.
            &lt;br /&gt;

   You may modify your copy or copies of the Program, and distribute the resulting derivative
                 works, provided that you meet the following conditions:

        &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ul style="list-style:none"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
               &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;a)&lt;/var&gt;
            The copyright notice and disclaimer on the Program must be reproduced and included in the
               source code, documentation, and/or other materials provided in a manner in which such
               notices are normally distributed.
          &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
               &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;b)&lt;/var&gt;
            The derivative work must be clearly identified as such, in order that it may not be confused
               with the original work.
          &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
               &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;c)&lt;/var&gt;
            The license under which the derivative work is distributed must expressly prohibit the
               distribution of further derivative works.
          &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;4.&lt;/var&gt;
          Modification and redistribution under open license.
            &lt;br /&gt;

   You may modify your copy or copies of the Program, and distribute the resulting derivative
                 works, provided that you meet the following conditions:

        &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ul style="list-style:none"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
               &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;a)&lt;/var&gt;
            The copyright notice and disclaimer on the Program must be reproduced and included in the
               source code, documentation, and/or other materials provided in a manner in which such
               notices are normally distributed.
          &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
               &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;b)&lt;/var&gt;
            You must clearly indicate the nature and date of any changes made to the Program. The full
               details need not necessarily be included in the individual modified files, provided that
               each modified file is clearly marked as such and instructions are included on where the
               full details of the modifications may be found.
          &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
               &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;c)&lt;/var&gt;
            You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or
               is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to
               all third parties under the terms of this License.
          &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;5.&lt;/var&gt;
          Implied acceptance.
            &lt;br /&gt;

   You may not copy or distribute the Program or any derivative works except as expressly
                 provided under this license. Consequently, any such action will be taken as implied
                 acceptance of the terms of this license.

        &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;6.&lt;/var&gt;
          NO WARRANTY.
        &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED &amp;quot;AS IS&amp;quot; AND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
         LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE
         DISCLAIMED. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
         REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
         EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING,
         BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES; LOSS OF USE, DATA, OR PROFITS; OR
         BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT
         LIABILITY, OR TORT, EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
         DAMAGES.&lt;/p&gt;
