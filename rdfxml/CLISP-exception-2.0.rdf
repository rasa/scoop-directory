      &lt;p&gt;Note:&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;This copyright does NOT cover user programs that run in CLISP and
       third-party packages not part of CLISP, if a) They only
       reference external symbols in CLISP&amp;apos;s public packages that
       define API also provided by many other Common Lisp
       implementations (namely the packages COMMON-LISP,
       COMMON-LISP-USER, KEYWORD, CLOS, GRAY, EXT), i.e. if they
       don&amp;apos;t rely on CLISP internals and would as well run in any
       other Common Lisp implementation. Or b) They only reference
       external symbols in CLISP&amp;apos;s public packages that define API
       also provided by many other Common Lisp implementations
       (namely the packages COMMON-LISP, COMMON-LISP-USER, KEYWORD,
       CLOS, GRAY, EXT) and some external, not CLISP specific,
       symbols in third-party packages that are released with source
       code under a GPL compatible license and that run in a great
       number of Common Lisp implementations, i.e. if they rely on
       CLISP internals only to the extent needed for gaining some
       functionality also available in a great number of Common Lisp
       implementations. Such user programs are not covered by the
       term &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;derived work&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot; used in the GNU GPL. Neither is
       their compiled code, i.e. the result of compiling them by use
       of the function COMPILE-FILE. We refer to such user programs
       as &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;independent work&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;You may copy and distribute memory image files generated by the
       function SAVEINITMEM, if it was generated only from CLISP and
       independent work, and provided that you accompany them, in the
       sense of section 3 of the GNU GPL, with the source code of
       CLISP - precisely the same CLISP version that was used to
       build the memory image -, the source or compiled code of the
       user programs needed to rebuild the memory image (source code
       for all the parts that are not independent work, see above),
       and a precise description how to rebuild the memory image from
       these.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Foreign non-Lisp code that is linked with CLISP or loaded into
       CLISP through dynamic linking is not exempted from this
       copyright. I.e. such code, when distributed for use with
       CLISP, must be distributed under the GPL.&lt;/p&gt;
