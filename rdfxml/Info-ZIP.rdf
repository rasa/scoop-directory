             copyright notice, definition, disclaimer, and this list of conditions in documentation
             and/or other materials provided with the distribution. Additional documentation is not
             needed for executables where a command line license option provides these and a note
             regarding this option is in the executable&amp;apos;s startup banner. The sole exception to
             this condition is redistribution of a standard UnZipSFX binary (including SFXWiz) as part
             of a self-extracting archive; that is permitted without inclusion of this license, as long
             as the normal SFX banner has not been removed from the binary or disabled.

             such and must not be misrepresented as being the original source or, if binaries, compiled
             from the original source. Such altered versions also must not be misrepresented as being

             the names &amp;quot;Info-ZIP&amp;quot; (or any variation thereof, including, but not limited to,
             different capitalizations), &amp;quot;Pocket UnZip,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;WiZ&amp;quot; or

             further prohibited from misrepresentative use of the Zip-Bugs or Info-ZIP e-mail addresses
             or the Info-ZIP URL(s), such as to imply Info-ZIP will provide support for the altered
