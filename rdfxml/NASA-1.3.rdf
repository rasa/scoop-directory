Each Contributor must characterize its alteration of the Subject Software as a Modification and must identify itself as the originator of its Modification in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Modification. In fulfillment of these requirements, Contributor must include a file (e.g., a change log file) that describes the alterations made and the date of the alterations, identifies Contributor as originator of the alterations, and consents to characterization of the alterations as a Modification, for example, by including a statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Software provided by Government Agency. Once consent is granted, it may not thereafter be revoked.

E. A Recipient may not make any representation in the Subject Software or in any promotional, advertising or other material that may be construed as an endorsement by Government Agency or by any prior Recipient of any product or service provided by Recipient, or that may seek to obtain commercial advantage by the fact of Government Agency's or a prior Recipient's participation in this Agreement.

F. In an effort to track usage and maintain accurate records of the Subject Software, each Recipient, upon receipt of the Subject Software, is requested to register with Government Agency by visiting the following website: ______.

Recipient's name and personal information shall be used for statistical purposes only. Once a Recipient makes a Modification available, it is requested that the Recipient inform Government Agency, by e-mail to the Government Agency Point of Contact listed in clause 5.F., how to access the Modification.

G. Each Contributor represents that that its Modification is believed to be Contributor's original creation and does not violate any existing agreements, regulations, statutes or rules, and further that Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this Agreement.

H. A Recipient may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity and/or liability obligations to one or more other Recipients of the Subject Software. A Recipient may do so, however, only on its own behalf and not on behalf of Government Agency or any other Recipient. Such a Recipient must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity and/or liability obligation is offered by that Recipient alone. Further, such Recipient agrees to indemnify Government Agency and every other Recipient for any liability incurred by them as a result of warranty, support, indemnity and/or liability offered by such Recipient.

I. A Recipient may create a Larger Work by combining Subject Software with separate software not governed by the terms of this agreement and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such case, the Recipient must make sure Subject Software, or portions thereof, included in the Larger Work is subject to this Agreement.

                    The rights granted under Paragraph B. also apply to the combination of a Contributor&amp;apos;s
                     Modification and the Subject Software if, at the time the Modification is added by the
                     Contributor, the addition of such Modification causes the combination to be covered by the
                     Covered Patents. It does not apply to any other combinations that include a Modification.
                &lt;/li&gt;

                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;D.&lt;/var&gt;
                  The rights granted in Paragraphs A. and B. allow the Recipient to sublicense those same rights.
                     Such sublicense must be under the same terms and conditions of this Agreement.

                    Distribution or Redistribution of the Subject Software must be made under this Agreement except
                     for additions covered under paragraph 3H.

                            Whenever a Recipient distributes or redistributes the Subject Software, a copy of this
                             Agreement must be included with each copy of the Subject Software; and
                        &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
                            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;2.&lt;/var&gt;
                            If Recipient distributes or redistributes the Subject Software in any form other than source
                               code, Recipient must also make the source code freely available, and must provide with
                               each copy of the Subject Software information on how to obtain the source code in a
                               reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.

                    Each Recipient must ensure that the following copyright notice appears prominently in the Subject

                    &lt;p&gt;[Government Agency will insert the applicable copyright notice in each agreement accompanying the

&lt;li&gt;

                    Each Contributor must characterize its alteration of the Subject Software as a Modification and
                     must identify itself as the originator of its Modification in a manner that reasonably allows
                     subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Modification. In fulfillment of these
                     requirements, Contributor must include a file (e.g., a change log file) that describes the
                     alterations made and the date of the alterations, identifies Contributor as originator of the
                     alterations, and consents to characterization of the alterations as a Modification, for
                     example, by including a statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly,
                     from Original Software provided by Government Agency. Once consent is granted, it may not
                     thereafter be revoked.

                    A Contributor may add its own copyright notice to the Subject Software. Once a copyright notice
                     has been added to the Subject Software, a Recipient may not remove it without the express
                     permission of the Contributor who added the notice.
                &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;

                    A Recipient may not make any representation in the Subject Software or in any promotional,
                     advertising or other material that may be construed as an endorsement by Government Agency or
                     by any prior Recipient of any product or service provided by Recipient, or that may seek to
                     obtain commercial advantage by the fact of Government Agency&amp;apos;s or a prior
                     Recipient&amp;apos;s participation in this Agreement.
                &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;

                    In an effort to track usage and maintain accurate records of the Subject Software, each
                     Recipient, upon receipt of the Subject Software, is requested to register with Government
                     Agency by visiting the following website: &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;_______________&lt;/var&gt;. Recipient&amp;apos;s name and personal
                     information shall be used for statistical purposes only. Once a Recipient makes a Modification
                     available, it is requested that the Recipient inform Government Agency at the web site
                     provided above how to access the Modification.
                    &lt;p&gt;[Alternative paragraph for use when a web site for release and monitoring of subject software
                     will not be supported by releasing Government Agency] In an effort to track usage and maintain
                     accurate records of the Subject Software, each Recipient, upon receipt of the Subject
                     Software, is requested to provide Government Agency, by e-mail to the Government Agency Point
                     of Contact listed in clause 5.F., the following information: &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;_______________&lt;/var&gt;. Recipient&amp;apos;s name and
                     personal information shall be used for statistical purposes only. Once a Recipient makes a
                     Modification available, it is requested that the Recipient inform Government Agency, by e-mail
                     to the Government Agency Point of Contact listed in clause 5.F., how to access the
                     Modification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
                    &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;G.&lt;/var&gt;
                    Each Contributor represents that that its Modification is believed to be Contributor&amp;apos;s
                     original creation and does not violate any existing agreements, regulations, statutes or
                     rules, and further that Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this
                     Agreement.
                &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
                    &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;H.&lt;/var&gt;
                    A Recipient may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity and/or
                     liability obligations to one or more other Recipients of the Subject Software. A Recipient may
                     do so, however, only on its own behalf and not on behalf of Government Agency or any other
                     Recipient. Such a Recipient must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support,
                     indemnity and/or liability obligation is offered by that Recipient alone. Further, such
                     Recipient agrees to indemnify Government Agency and every other Recipient for any liability
                     incurred by them as a result of warranty, support, indemnity and/or liability offered by such
                     Recipient.
                &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
                    &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;I.&lt;/var&gt;
                    A Recipient may create a Larger Work by combining Subject Software with separate software not
                     governed by the terms of this agreement and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In
                     such case, the Recipient must make sure Subject Software, or portions thereof, included in the
                     Larger Work is subject to this Agreement.
                &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
                    &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;J.&lt;/var&gt;
                    Notwithstanding any provisions contained herein, Recipient is hereby put on notice that export of
                     any goods or technical data from the United States may require some form of export license
                     from the U.S. Government. Failure to obtain necessary export licenses may result in criminal
                     liability under U.S. laws. Government Agency neither represents that a license shall not be
                     required nor that, if required, it shall be issued. Nothing granted herein provides any such
                     export license.
                &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;

                    No Warranty: THE SUBJECT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED &amp;quot;AS IS&amp;quot; WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
                     EITHER EXPRESSED, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY WARRANTY THAT THE

                     SOFTWARE WILL BE ERROR FREE, OR ANY WARRANTY THAT DOCUMENTATION, IF PROVIDED, WILL CONFORM TO
                     THE SUBJECT SOFTWARE. THIS AGREEMENT DOES NOT, IN ANY MANNER, CONSTITUTE AN ENDORSEMENT BY
                     GOVERNMENT AGENCY OR ANY PRIOR RECIPIENT OF ANY RESULTS, RESULTING DESIGNS, HARDWARE, SOFTWARE
                     PRODUCTS OR ANY OTHER APPLICATIONS RESULTING FROM USE OF THE SUBJECT SOFTWARE. FURTHER,
                     GOVERNMENT AGENCY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND LIABILITIES REGARDING THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE, IF
                     PRESENT IN THE ORIGINAL SOFTWARE, AND DISTRIBUTES IT &amp;quot;AS IS.&amp;quot;
                &lt;/li&gt;

                    Waiver and Indemnity: RECIPIENT AGREES TO WAIVE ANY AND ALL CLAIMS AGAINST THE UNITED STATES
                     GOVERNMENT, ITS CONTRACTORS AND SUBCONTRACTORS, AS WELL AS ANY PRIOR RECIPIENT. IF
                     RECIPIENT&amp;apos;S USE OF THE SUBJECT SOFTWARE RESULTS IN ANY LIABILITIES, DEMANDS, DAMAGES,
                     EXPENSES OR LOSSES ARISING FROM SUCH USE, INCLUDING ANY DAMAGES FROM PRODUCTS BASED ON, OR
                     RESULTING FROM, RECIPIENT&amp;apos;S USE OF THE SUBJECT SOFTWARE, RECIPIENT SHALL INDEMNIFY AND
                     HOLD HARMLESS THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT, ITS CONTRACTORS AND SUBCONTRACTORS, AS WELL AS ANY
                     PRIOR RECIPIENT, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. RECIPIENT&amp;apos;S SOLE REMEDY FOR ANY SUCH
                     MATTER SHALL BE THE IMMEDIATE, UNILATERAL TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT.
                &lt;/li&gt;

                    Termination: This Agreement and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if a
                     Recipient fails to comply with these terms and conditions, and fails to cure such
                     noncompliance within thirty (30) days of becoming aware of such noncompliance. Upon
                     termination, a Recipient agrees to immediately cease use and distribution of the Subject
                     Software. All sublicenses to the Subject Software properly granted by the breaching Recipient
                     shall survive any such termination of this Agreement.
                &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
                    &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;B.&lt;/var&gt;
                    Severability: If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
                     law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this
                     Agreement.
                &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
                    &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;C.&lt;/var&gt;
                    Applicable Law: This Agreement shall be subject to United States federal law only for all
                     purposes, including, but not limited to, determining the validity of this Agreement, the
                     meaning of its provisions and the rights, obligations and remedies of the parties.
                &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
                    &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;D.&lt;/var&gt;
                    Entire Understanding: This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding and agreement of the
                     parties relating to release of the Subject Software and may not be superseded, modified or
                     amended except by further written agreement duly executed by the parties.
                &lt;/li&gt;

                    Binding Authority: By accepting and using the Subject Software under this Agreement, a Recipient
                     affirms its authority to bind the Recipient to all terms and conditions of this Agreement and
                     that that Recipient hereby agrees to all terms and conditions herein.
                &lt;/li&gt;

                     designated representative as follows: &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;_______________&lt;/var&gt;.

No copyright is claimed in the United States under Title 17, U.S.Code. All Other Rights Reserved.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="C.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Each Contributor must characterize its alteration of the Subject Software as a Modification and must identify itself as the originator of its Modification in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Modification. In fulfillment of these requirements, Contributor must include a file (e.g., a change log file) that describes the alterations made and the date of the alterations, identifies Contributor as originator of the alterations, and consents to characterization of the alterations as a Modification, for example, by including a statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Software provided by Government Agency. Once consent is granted, it may not thereafter be revoked.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="D.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; A Contributor may add its own copyright notice to the Subject Software. Once a copyright notice has been added to the Subject Software, a Recipient may not remove it without the express permission of the Contributor who added the notice.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="E.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; A Recipient may not make any representation in the Subject Software or in any promotional, advertising or other material that may be construed as an endorsement by Government Agency or by any prior Recipient of any product or service provided by Recipient, or that may seek to obtain commercial advantage by the fact of Government Agency's or a prior Recipient's participation in this Agreement.

Recipient's name and personal information shall be used for statistical purposes only. Once a Recipient makes a Modification available, it is requested that the Recipient inform Government Agency, by e-mail to the Government Agency Point of Contact listed in clause 5.F., how to access the Modification.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="G.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Each Contributor represents that that its Modification is believed to be Contributor's original creation and does not violate any existing agreements, regulations, statutes or rules, and further that Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this Agreement.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="H.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; A Recipient may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity and/or liability obligations to one or more other Recipients of the Subject Software. A Recipient may do so, however, only on its own behalf and not on behalf of Government Agency or any other Recipient. Such a Recipient must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity and/or liability obligation is offered by that Recipient alone. Further, such Recipient agrees to indemnify Government Agency and every other Recipient for any liability incurred by them as a result of warranty, support, indemnity and/or liability offered by such Recipient.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="I.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; A Recipient may create a Larger Work by combining Subject Software with separate software not governed by the terms of this agreement and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such case, the Recipient must make sure Subject Software, or portions thereof, included in the Larger Work is subject to this Agreement.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="J.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Notwithstanding any provisions contained herein, Recipient is hereby put on notice that export of any goods or technical data from the United States may require some form of export license from the U.S. Government. Failure to obtain necessary export licenses may result in criminal liability under U.S. laws. Government Agency neither represents that a license shall not be required nor that, if required, it shall be issued. Nothing granted herein provides any such export license.
