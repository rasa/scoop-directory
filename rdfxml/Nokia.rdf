   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.1";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Application of License.

   The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Software may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.2";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Availability of Source Code.

   Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.3";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Description of Modifications.

   You must cause all Covered Software to which You contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Software and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Software provided by Nokia and including the name of Nokia in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Software.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.4";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Intellectual Property Matters

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="(a)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Third Party Claims. If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Software that new knowledge has been obtained.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="(b)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Contributor APIs. If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL file.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="(c)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Representations. Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.5";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Required Notices.

   You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Software. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of Nokia or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify Nokia and every Contributor for any liability incurred by Nokia or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.6";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Distribution of Executable Versions.

   You may distribute Covered Software in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Software, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Software is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Software. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Software or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by Nokia or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify Nokia and every Contributor for any liability incurred by Nokia or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.7";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Larger Works.

   You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other software not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Software. &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="4.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; INABILITY TO COMPLY DUE TO STATUTE OR REGULATION.

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code.

Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

&lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="5.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; APPLICATION OF THIS LICENSE.

This License applies to code to which Nokia has attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Software. &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="6.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; VERSIONS OF THE LICENSE.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="6.1";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; New Versions.

   Nokia may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="6.2";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Effect of New Versions.

   Once Covered Software has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Software under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Nokia. No one other than Nokia has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Software created under this License. &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="7.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT NOKIA, ITS LICENSORS OR AFFILIATES OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER. &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="8.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; TERMINATION.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="8.1";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Software which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="8.2";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Nokia or a Contributor (Nokia or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as "Participant") alleging that:

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="a)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="b)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="8.3";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="8.4";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination. &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="9.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, NOKIA, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, BUT MAY ALLOW LIABILITY TO BE LIMITED; IN SUCH CASES, A PARTY's, ITS EMPLOYEES, LICENSORS OR AFFILIATES' LIABILITY SHALL BE LIMITED TO U.S. $50. Nothing contained in this License shall prejudice the statutory rights of any party dealing as a consumer. &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="10.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; MISCELLANEOUS.

This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. All rights in the Covered Software not expressly granted under this License are reserved. Nothing in this License shall grant You any rights to use any of the trademarks of Nokia or any of its Affiliates, even if any of such trademarks are included in any part of Covered Software and/or documentation to it.

This License is governed by the laws of Finland excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. All disputes arising from or relating to this Agreement shall be settled by a single arbitrator appointed by the Central Chamber of Commerce of Finland. The arbitration procedure shall take place in Helsinki, Finland in the English language. If any part of this Agreement is found void and unenforceable, it will not affect the validity of the balance of the Agreement, which shall remain valid and enforceable according to its terms.

&lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="11.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

As between Nokia and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Nokia and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis.

     3.4 Intellectual Property Matters

          (a) Third Party Claims. If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Software that new knowledge has been obtained.

          (b) Contributor APIs. If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL file.

          (c) Representations. Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.

     3.5 Required Notices.
     You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Software. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of Nokia or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify Nokia and every Contributor for any liability incurred by Nokia or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

     3.6 Distribution of Executable Versions.
     You may distribute Covered Software in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Software, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Software is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Software. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Software or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by Nokia or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify Nokia and every Contributor for any liability incurred by Nokia or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.

     3.7 Larger Works.
     You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other software not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Software.

4. INABILITY TO COMPLY DUE TO STATUTE OR REGULATION.
If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code.

Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5. APPLICATION OF THIS LICENSE.
This License applies to code to which Nokia has attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Software.

6. VERSIONS OF THE LICENSE.

     6.1 New Versions.
     Nokia may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.

     6.2 Effect of New Versions.
     Once Covered Software has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Software under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Nokia. No one other than Nokia has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Software created under this License.

7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT NOKIA, ITS LICENSORS OR AFFILIATES OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

8. TERMINATION.

     8.1 This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Software which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

     8.2 If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Nokia or a Contributor (Nokia or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as "Participant") alleging that:

          a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.

          b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant.

     8.3 If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.

     8.4 In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.

9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, NOKIA, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, BUT MAY ALLOW LIABILITY TO BE LIMITED; IN SUCH CASES, A PARTY's, ITS EMPLOYEES, LICENSORS OR AFFILIATES' LIABILITY SHALL BE LIMITED TO U.S. $50. Nothing contained in this License shall prejudice the statutory rights of any party dealing as a consumer.

10. MISCELLANEOUS.
This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. All rights in the Covered Software not expressly granted under this License are reserved. Nothing in this License shall grant You any rights to use any of the trademarks of Nokia or any of its Affiliates, even if any of such trademarks are included in any part of Covered Software and/or documentation to it.

This License is governed by the laws of Finland excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. All disputes arising from or relating to this Agreement shall be settled by a single arbitrator appointed by the Central Chamber of Commerce of Finland. The arbitration procedure shall take place in Helsinki, Finland in the English language. If any part of this Agreement is found void and unenforceable, it will not affect the validity of the balance of the Agreement, which shall remain valid and enforceable according to its terms.

11. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.
As between Nokia and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Nokia and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

                     copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may
                     not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts
                     the applicable version of this License or the recipients&amp;apos; rights hereunder.
                     However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights
                     described in Section 3.5.

                     Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone
                     to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via
                     Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)
                     months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months
                     after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made available
                     to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version
                     remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a
                     third party.

            &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;3.3&lt;/var&gt;
              Description of Modifications.
                &lt;br /&gt;

   You must cause all Covered Software to which You contribute to contain a file
                     documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Software and the date of
                     any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is
                     derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Software provided by Nokia and
                     including the name of Nokia in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an
                     Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or
                     ownership of the Covered Software.

            &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;3.4&lt;/var&gt;
              Intellectual Property Matters
              
&lt;ul style="list-style:none"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
                        &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;(a)&lt;/var&gt;
                  Third Party Claims. If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third
                     party&amp;apos;s intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted
                     by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file
                     with the Source Code distribution titled &amp;quot;LEGAL&amp;quot; which describes the claim
                     and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to
                     contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made
                     available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL
                     file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps
                     (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to
                     inform those who received the Covered Software that new knowledge has been
                     obtained.
                &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
                        &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;(b)&lt;/var&gt;
                  Contributor APIs. If Contributor&amp;apos;s Modifications include an application programming
                     interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably
                     necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also include this information in the
                     LEGAL file.
                &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
                        &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;(c)&lt;/var&gt;
                  Representations. Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section
                     3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor&amp;apos;s Modifications are
                     Contributor&amp;apos;s original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to
                     grant the rights conveyed by this License.
                &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
               &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;3.5&lt;/var&gt;
              Required Notices.
                &lt;br /&gt;

   You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If it is
                     not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its
                     structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant
                     directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created
                     one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice
                     described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation
                     for the Source Code where You describe recipients&amp;apos; rights or ownership rights
                     relating to Covered Software. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,
                     warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of
                     Covered Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
                     behalf of Nokia or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
                     such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone,
                     and You hereby agree to indemnify Nokia and every Contributor for any liability
                     incurred by Nokia or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity
                     or liability terms You offer.

            &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;3.6&lt;/var&gt;
              Distribution of Executable Versions.
                &lt;br /&gt;

   You may distribute Covered Software in Executable form only if the requirements of
                     Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Software, and if You include a
                     notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Software is available
                     under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have
                     fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously
                     included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or
                     collateral in which You describe recipients&amp;apos; rights relating to the Covered
                     Software. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Software or
                     ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different
                     from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this
                     License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit
                     or alter the recipient&amp;apos;s rights in the Source Code version from the rights
                     set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a
                     different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ
                     from this License are offered by You alone, not by Nokia or any Contributor. You
                     hereby agree to indemnify Nokia and every Contributor for any liability incurred
                     by Nokia or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.

            &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;3.7&lt;/var&gt;
              Larger Works.
                &lt;br /&gt;

   You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other software not
                     governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single
                     product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are
                     fulfilled for the Covered Software.

            &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;4.&lt;/var&gt;
          INABILITY TO COMPLY DUE TO STATUTE OR REGULATION.
            &lt;br /&gt;

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to
                 some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then
                 You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible;
                 and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be
                 included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all
                 distributions of the Source Code.

          &lt;p&gt;Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently
             detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;5.&lt;/var&gt;
          APPLICATION OF THIS LICENSE.
            &lt;br /&gt;

This License applies to code to which Nokia has attached the notice in Exhibit A and to
                 related Covered Software.
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;6.&lt;/var&gt;
          VERSIONS OF THE LICENSE.
          
&lt;ul style="list-style:none"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;6.1&lt;/var&gt;
              New Versions.
                &lt;br /&gt;

   Nokia may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each
                     version will be given a distinguishing version number.

            &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;6.2&lt;/var&gt;
              Effect of New Versions.
                &lt;br /&gt;

   Once Covered Software has been published under a particular version of the License, You
                     may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose
                     to use such Covered Software under the terms of any subsequent version of the
                     License published by Nokia. No one other than Nokia has the right to modify the
                     terms applicable to Covered Software created under this License.

            &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;7.&lt;/var&gt;
          DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
            &lt;br /&gt;

COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN &amp;quot;AS IS&amp;quot; BASIS, WITHOUT
                 WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
                 WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A
                 PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
                 PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE
                 DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT NOKIA, ITS LICENSORS OR AFFILIATES OR ANY OTHER
                 CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS
                 DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY
                 COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;8.&lt;/var&gt;
          TERMINATION.
          
&lt;ul style="list-style:none"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;8.1&lt;/var&gt;
              This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to
                 comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of
                 the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Software which are properly granted shall
                 survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in
                 effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.
            &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;8.2&lt;/var&gt;
              If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declatory
                 judgment actions) against Nokia or a Contributor (Nokia or Contributor against whom You
                 file such action is referred to as &amp;quot;Participant&amp;quot;) alleging that:
              
&lt;ul style="list-style:none"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
                        &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;a)&lt;/var&gt;
                  such Participant&amp;apos;s Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent,
                     then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or
                     2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate
                     prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree
                     in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past
                     and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your
                     litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If
                     within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not
                     mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not
                     withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2
                     automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified
                     above.
                &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
                        &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;b)&lt;/var&gt;
                  any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant&amp;apos;s Contributor
                     Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You
                     by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the
                     date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that
                     Participant.
                &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
               &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;8.3&lt;/var&gt;
              If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such
                 Participant&amp;apos;s Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where
                 such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of
                 patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such
                 Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the
                 amount or value of any payment or license.
            &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;8.4&lt;/var&gt;
              In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license agreements
                 (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any
                 distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.
            &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;9.&lt;/var&gt;
          LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
            &lt;br /&gt;

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE),
                 CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, NOKIA, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF
                 COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR
                 ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER
                 INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER
                 FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF
                 SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS
                 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY
                 RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY&amp;apos;S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS
                 SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF
                 INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, BUT MAY ALLOW LIABILITY TO BE LIMITED; IN SUCH
                 CASES, A PARTY&amp;apos;s, ITS EMPLOYEES, LICENSORS OR AFFILIATES&amp;apos; LIABILITY SHALL BE
                 LIMITED TO U.S. $50. Nothing contained in this License shall prejudice the statutory
                 rights of any party dealing as a consumer.
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;10.&lt;/var&gt;
          MISCELLANEOUS.
            &lt;br /&gt;

This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. All rights
                 in the Covered Software not expressly granted under this License are reserved. Nothing
                 in this License shall grant You any rights to use any of the trademarks of Nokia or
                 any of its Affiliates, even if any of such trademarks are included in any part of
                 Covered Software and/or documentation to it.

          &lt;p&gt;This License is governed by the laws of Finland excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. All
             disputes arising from or relating to this Agreement shall be settled by a single arbitrator
             appointed by the Central Chamber of Commerce of Finland. The arbitration procedure shall take
             place in Helsinki, Finland in the English language. If any part of this Agreement is found
             void and unenforceable, it will not affect the validity of the balance of the Agreement, which
             shall remain valid and enforceable according to its terms.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;11.&lt;/var&gt;
          RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.&lt;br /&gt;

             As between Nokia and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly
             or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Nokia
             and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended
             or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.
