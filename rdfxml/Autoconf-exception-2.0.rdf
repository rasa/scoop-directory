      &lt;p&gt;As a special exception, the Free Software Foundation gives
         unlimited permission to copy, distribute and modify the
         configure scripts that are the output of Autoconf. You need
         not follow the terms of the GNU General Public License when
         using or distributing such scripts, even though portions of
         the text of Autoconf appear in them. The GNU General Public
         License (GPL) does govern all other use of the material that
         constitutes the Autoconf program.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Certain portions of the Autoconf source text are designed to be
         copied (in certain cases, depending on the input) into the
         output of Autoconf. We call these the &amp;quot;data&amp;quot; portions. The
         rest of the Autoconf source text consists of comments plus
         executable code that decides which of the data portions to
         output in any given case. We call these comments and
         executable code the &amp;quot;non-data&amp;quot; portions. Autoconf never copies
         any of the non-data portions into its output.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;This special exception to the GPL applies to versions of Autoconf
         released by the Free Software Foundation. When you make and
         distribute a modified version of Autoconf, you may extend this
         special exception to the GPL to apply to your modified version
         as well, *unless* your modified version has the potential to
         copy into its output some of the text that was the non-data
         portion of the version that you started with. (In other words,
         unless your change moves or copies text from the non-data
         portions to the data portions.) If your modification has such
         potential, you must delete any notice of this special
         exception to the GPL from your modified version.&lt;/p&gt;
