      &lt;p&gt;Even though U-Boot in general is covered by the GPL-2.0/GPL-2.0+,
         this does *not* cover the so-called &amp;quot;standalone&amp;quot; applications
         that use U-Boot services by means of the jump table provided
         by U-Boot exactly for this purpose - this is merely considered
         normal use of U-Boot, and does *not* fall under the heading of
         &amp;quot;derived work&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;The header files &amp;quot;include/image.h&amp;quot; and
         &amp;quot;arch/*/include/asm/u-boot.h&amp;quot; define interfaces to U-Boot.
         Including these (unmodified) header files in another file is
         considered normal use of U-Boot, and does *not* fall under the
         heading of &amp;quot;derived work&amp;quot;.

    <spdx:licenseExceptionText>The U-Boot License Exception:

Even though U-Boot in general is covered by the GPL-2.0/GPL-2.0+, this does *not* cover the so-called "standalone" applications that use U-Boot services by means of the jump table provided by U-Boot exactly for this purpose - this is merely considered normal use of U-Boot, and does *not* fall under the heading of "derived work".

The header files "include/image.h" and "arch/*/include/asm/u-boot.h" define interfaces to U-Boot. Including these (unmodified) header files in another file is considered normal use of U-Boot, and does *not* fall under the heading of "derived work".
