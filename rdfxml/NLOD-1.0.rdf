                 source of the information.

          &lt;p&gt;If the licensor has not specified how attributions shall
             be made, the licensee shall normally state the
             following: «Contains data under the Norwegian licence
             for Open Government data (NLOD) distributed by [name
             of licensor]».&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;If the licensor has specified that the information shall
             only be available under a specific version of this
             licence, cf. Section 10, the licensee shall also state
             this.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;If the information has been changed, the licensee must
             clearly indicate that changes have been made by the
             licensee.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;6.&lt;/var&gt;
          Proper use
            &lt;br /&gt;

   The licensee shall not use the information in a
                 manner that appears misleading nor present the
                 information in a distorted or incorrect
                 manner.
            &lt;br /&gt;

   Neither the licensor&amp;apos;s nor other contributors&amp;apos;
                 names or trademarks must be used to support,
                 recommend or market the licensee or any
                 products or services using the information.

        &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;7.&lt;/var&gt;
          Disclaimer of liability
            &lt;br /&gt;

   The information is licensed «as is». The
                 information may contain errors and omissions.
                 The licensor provides no warranties, including
                 relating to the content and relevance of the
                 information.

          &lt;p&gt;The licensor disclaims any liability for errors and
             defects associated with the information to the maximum
             extent permitted by law.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;The licensor shall not be liable for direct or indirect
             losses as a result of use of the information or in
             connection with copying or further distribution of the
             information.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;8.&lt;/var&gt;
          Guarantees regarding data quality and accessibility
            &lt;br /&gt;

   This licence does not prevent the licensor from
                 issuing supplementary statements regarding
                 expected or intended data quality and
                 accessibility. Such statements shall be
                 regarded as indicative in nature and not
                 binding on the part of the licensor. The
                 disclaimers in Section 7 also apply in full
                 for such indicative statements. Based on
                 separate agreement, the licensor may provide
                 guarantees and distribute the information on
                 terms and conditions different from those set
                 forth in this licence.

        &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;9.&lt;/var&gt;
          Licence compatibility
            &lt;br /&gt;

   If the licensee is to distribute an adapted or
                 combined work based on information covered by
                 this licence and some other work licensed
                 under a licence compatible by contract, such
                 distribution may be based on an appropriate
                 licence compatible by contract, cf. the list
                 below.

          &lt;p&gt;A licence compatible by contract shall mean the following
             licences:&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
      
&lt;ul style="list-style:none"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;*&lt;/var&gt;
          for all information: Open Government Licence (version 1.0),
        &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;*&lt;/var&gt;
          for those parts of the information which do not
             constitute databases: Creative Commons Attribution
             Licence (generic version 1.0, 2.0, 2.5 and unported

            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;*&lt;/var&gt;
          for those parts of the information which constitute
             databases: Open Data Commons Attribution License
             (version 1.0).
          &lt;p&gt;This provision does not prevent other licences from being
             compatible with this licence based on their
             content.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;10.&lt;/var&gt;
          New versions of the licence
            &lt;br /&gt;

   The licensee may choose to use the information
                 covered by this licence under any new versions
                 of the Norwegian licence for Open Government
                 data (NLOD) issued by the responsible ministry
                 (currently the Ministry of Government
                 Administration, Reform and Church Affairs)
                 when these versions are final and official,
                 unless the licensor when making the
                 information available under this licence
                 specifically has stated that solely version
                 1.0 of this licence may be used.

        &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;11.&lt;/var&gt;
          Governing law and legal venue
        &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This licence, including its formation, and any disputes and
         claims arising in connection with or relating to this licence,
         shall be regulated by Norwegian law. The legal venue shall be
         the licensor&amp;apos;s ordinary legal venue. The licensor may, with
         regard to intellectual proprietary rights, choose to pursue a
         claim at other competent legal venues and/or based on the laws
         of the country where the intellectual property rights are
         sought enforced.&lt;/p&gt;
