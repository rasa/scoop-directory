            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;2.&lt;/var&gt;
          Subject to the terms and conditions of this License Agreement, CNRI hereby grants Licensee a
             nonexclusive, royalty-free, world-wide license to reproduce, analyze, test, perform and/or

             any part thereof, and wants to make the derivative work available to others as provided
