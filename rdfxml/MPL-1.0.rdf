2. Source Code License.

     2.1. The Initial Developer Grant.
The Initial Developer hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property claims:

          (a) to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Original Code (or portions thereof) with or without Modifications, or as part of a Larger Work; and

          (b) under patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by Initial Developer, to make, have made, use and sell (``Utilize'') the Original Code (or portions thereof), but solely to the extent that any such patent is reasonably necessary to enable You to Utilize 	the Original Code (or portions thereof) and not to any greater extent that may be necessary to Utilize further Modifications or combinations.

     2.2. Contributor Grant.
Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property claims:

          (a) to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications created by such Contributor (or portions thereof) either on an unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Code or as part of a Larger Work; and

          (b) under patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by Contributor, to Utilize the Contributor Version (or portions thereof), but solely to the extent that any such patent is reasonably necessary to enable You to Utilize the Contributor Version (or portions 	thereof), and not to any greater extent that may be necessary to Utilize further Modifications or combinations.

3. Distribution Obligations.

     3.1. Application of License.
     The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.

     3.2. Availability of Source Code.
     Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.

     3.3. Description of Modifications.
     You must cause all Covered Code to which you contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.

     3.4. Intellectual Property Matters

          (a) Third Party Claims.
          If You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual property right in particular functionality or code (or its utilization under this License), you must include a text file with the source code distribution titled ``LEGAL'' which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after You make Your Modification available as described in Section 3.2, You shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.

          (b) Contributor APIs.
          If Your Modification is an application programming interface and You own or control patents which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, you must also include this information in the LEGAL file.

     3.5. Required Notices.
     You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code, and this License in any documentation for the Source Code, where You describe recipients' rights relating to Covered Code. If You created one or more Modification(s), You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then you must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

     3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.
     You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.

     3.7. Larger Works.
     You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.
If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5. Application of this License.
This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code.

6. Versions of the License.

     6.1. New Versions.
     Netscape Communications Corporation (``Netscape'') may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.

     6.2. Effect of New Versions.
     Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.

     6.3. Derivative Works.
     If you create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), you must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases ``Mozilla'', ``MOZILLAPL'', ``MOZPL'', ``Netscape'', ``NPL'' or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear anywhere in your license and (b) otherwise make it clear that your version of the license contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)

7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN ``AS IS'' BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

8. TERMINATION.
This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.
The Covered Code is a ``commercial item,'' as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of ``commercial computer software'' and ``commercial computer software documentation,'' as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.

11. MISCELLANEOUS.
This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in, the United States of America: (a) unless otherwise agreed in writing, all disputes relating to this License (excepting any dispute relating to intellectual property rights) shall be subject to final and binding arbitration, with the losing party paying all costs of arbitration; (b) any arbitration relating to this Agreement shall be held in Santa Clara County, California, under the auspices of JAMS/EndDispute; and (c) any litigation relating to this Agreement shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.

12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.
Except in cases where another Contributor has failed to comply with Section 3.4, You are responsible for damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of Your utilization of rights under this License, based on the number of copies of Covered Code you made available, the revenues you received from utilizing such rights, and other relevant factors. You agree to work with affected parties to distribute responsibility on an equitable basis.

                     created by such Contributor (or portions thereof) either on an unmodified basis, with
                     other Modifications, as Covered Code or as part of a Larger Work; and
                &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
                        &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;(b)&lt;/var&gt;
                  under patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by Contributor, to Utilize the
                     Contributor Version (or portions thereof), but solely to the extent that any such
                     patent is reasonably necessary to enable You to Utilize the Contributor Version (or
                     portions thereof), and not to any greater extent that may be necessary to Utilize
                     further Modifications or combinations.

              Application of License.
                &lt;br /&gt;

      The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms
                     of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version
                     of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a
                     future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a
                     copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may
                     not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts
                     the applicable version of this License or the recipients&amp;apos; rights hereunder.
                     However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights
                     described in Section 3.5.

            &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;

              Availability of Source Code.
                &lt;br /&gt;

      Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in
                     Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an
                     Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone
                     to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via
                     Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)
                     months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months
                     after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made available
                     to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version
                     remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a
                     third party.

            &lt;/li&gt;

              Description of Modifications.
                &lt;br /&gt;

      You must cause all Covered Code to which you contribute to contain a file documenting
                     the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You
                     must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or
                     indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the
                     name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an
                     Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or
                     ownership of the Covered Code.

            &lt;/li&gt;

                  Third Party Claims.
                    &lt;br /&gt;

         If You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual property right in
                         particular functionality or code (or its utilization under this License), you
                         must include a text file with the source code distribution titled
                         &amp;quot;LEGAL&amp;quot; which describes the claim and the party making the claim
                         in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If you obtain
                         such knowledge after You make Your Modification available as described in
                         Section 3.2, You shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make
                         available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate
                         mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who
                         received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.

                &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
                        &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;(b)&lt;/var&gt;
                  Contributor APIs.
                    &lt;br /&gt;

         If Your Modification is an application programming interface and You own or control
                         patents which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, you must also
                         include this information in the LEGAL file.

                &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
               &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;3.5.&lt;/var&gt;
              Required Notices.
                &lt;br /&gt;

      You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code, and this
                     License in any documentation for the Source Code, where You describe
                     recipients&amp;apos; rights relating to Covered Code. If You created one or more
                     Modification(s), You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in
                     Exhibit A. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code
                     file due to its structure, then you must include such notice in a location (such
                     as a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a
                     notice. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
                     indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code.
                     However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial
                     Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such
                     warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and
                     You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any
                     liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of
                     warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

            &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;3.6.&lt;/var&gt;
              Distribution of Executable Versions.
                &lt;br /&gt;

      You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section
                     3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating
                     that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of
                     this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the
                     obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any
                     notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You
                     describe recipients&amp;apos; rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute
                     the Executable version of Covered Code under a license of Your choice, which may
                     contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance
                     with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version
                     does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient&amp;apos;s rights in the Source Code
                     version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the
                     Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear
                     that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the
                     Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
                     Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial
                     Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.

            &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;3.7.&lt;/var&gt;
              Larger Works.
                &lt;br /&gt;

      You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by
                     the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In
                     such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for
                     the Covered Code.

            &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;4.&lt;/var&gt;
          Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.
            &lt;br /&gt;

   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to
                 some or all of the Covered Code due to statute or regulation then You must: (a) comply
                 with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the
                 limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL
                 file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the
                 Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such
                 description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able
                 to understand it.

        &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;5.&lt;/var&gt;
          Application of this License.
            &lt;br /&gt;

   This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in
                 Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code.

        &lt;/li&gt;

              New Versions.
                &lt;br /&gt;

      Netscape Communications Corporation (&amp;quot;Netscape&amp;quot;) may publish revised and/or
                     new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a
                     distinguishing version number.

            &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt;6.2.&lt;/var&gt;
              Effect of New Versions.
                &lt;br /&gt;

      Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may
                     always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to
                     use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License
                     published by Netscape. No one other than Netscape has the right to modify the
                     terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.

            &lt;/li&gt;

              Derivative Works.
                &lt;br /&gt;

      If you create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order
                     to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License),
                     you must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases &amp;quot;Mozilla&amp;quot;,
                     &amp;quot;MOZILLAPL&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;MOZPL&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Netscape&amp;quot;,
                     &amp;quot;NPL&amp;quot; or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear anywhere in your
                     license and (b) otherwise make it clear that your version of the license contains
                     terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public License.
                     (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the
                     notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be
                     modifications of this License.)

          DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
            &lt;br /&gt;

   COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN &amp;quot;AS IS&amp;quot; BASIS, WITHOUT
                 WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
                 WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A
                 PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
                 PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE
                 IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE
                 COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY
                 CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS
                 AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

          TERMINATION.
            &lt;br /&gt;

   This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to
                 comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware
                 of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall
                 survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must
                 remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

        &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;

          LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
            &lt;br /&gt;

   UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE),
                 CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY
                 DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO YOU
                 OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF
                 ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK
                 STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR
                 LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
                 DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR
                 PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY&amp;apos;S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE
                 LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR
                 LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION
                 MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

   The Covered Code is a &amp;quot;commercial item,&amp;quot; as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R.
                 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of &amp;quot;commercial computer software&amp;quot; and

                 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code

          MISCELLANEOUS.
            &lt;br /&gt;

   This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any
                 provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be
                 reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be
                 governed by California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any,
                 provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to
                 disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or
                 registered to do business in, the United States of America: (a) unless otherwise
                 agreed in writing, all disputes relating to this License (excepting any dispute
                 relating to intellectual property rights) shall be subject to final and binding
                 arbitration, with the losing party paying all costs of arbitration; (b) any
                 arbitration relating to this Agreement shall be held in Santa Clara County,
                 California, under the auspices of JAMS/EndDispute; and (c) any litigation relating to
                 this Agreement shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the
                 Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California,
                 with the losing party responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs
                 and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations
                 Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any
                 law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed
                 against the drafter shall not apply to this License.

          RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.
            &lt;br /&gt;

   Except in cases where another Contributor has failed to comply with Section 3.4, You are responsible for
                 damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of Your utilization of rights under this License, based
                 on the number of copies of Covered Code you made available, the revenues you received from utilizing
                 such rights, and other relevant factors. You agree to work with affected parties to distribute
                 responsibility on an equitable basis.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="2.2.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Contributor Grant.

      Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property claims:

         &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="(a)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications created by such Contributor (or portions thereof) either on an unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Code or as part of a Larger Work; and

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Distribution Obligations.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.1.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Application of License.

      The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.2.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Availability of Source Code.

      Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.3.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Description of Modifications.

      You must cause all Covered Code to which you contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.4.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Intellectual Property Matters

         &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="(a)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Third Party Claims.

         If You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual property right in particular functionality or code (or its utilization under this License), you must include a text file with the source code distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after You make Your Modification available as described in Section 3.2, You shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.

         &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="(b)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Contributor APIs.

         If Your Modification is an application programming interface and You own or control patents which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, you must also include this information in the LEGAL file.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.5.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Required Notices.

      You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code, and this License in any documentation for the Source Code, where You describe recipients' rights relating to Covered Code. If You created one or more Modification(s), You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then you must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.6.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Distribution of Executable Versions.

      You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.7.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Larger Works.

      You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="4.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.

   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="5.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Application of this License.

   This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="6.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Versions of the License.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="6.1.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; New Versions.

      Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="6.2.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Effect of New Versions.

      Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="6.3.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Derivative Works.

      If you create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), you must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases "Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", "Netscape", "NPL" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear anywhere in your license and (b) otherwise make it clear that your version of the license contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="7.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

   COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="8.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; TERMINATION.

   This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="9.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

   UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="10.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

   The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer software" and "commercial computer software documentation," as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="11.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; MISCELLANEOUS.

   This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in, the United States of America: (a) unless otherwise agreed in writing, all disputes relating to this License (excepting any dispute relating to intellectual property rights) shall be subject to final and binding arbitration, with the losing party paying all costs of arbitration; (b) any arbitration relating to this Agreement shall be held in Santa Clara County, California, under the auspices of JAMS/EndDispute; and (c) any litigation relating to this Agreement shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="12.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

   Except in cases where another Contributor has failed to comply with Section 3.4, You are responsible for damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of Your utilization of rights under this License, based on the number of copies of Covered Code you made available, the revenues you received from utilizing such rights, and other relevant factors. You agree to work with affected parties to distribute responsibility on an equitable basis.&lt;&lt;beginOptional&gt;&gt; EXHIBIT A.
